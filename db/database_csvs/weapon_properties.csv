name,description
Accurate,"Some weapons are designed with precision in mind and respond superbly to skilled hands. They grant an additional bonus of +10 to the firer’s Ballistic Skill when used with an Aim Action, in addition to the bonus granted from Aiming. When fi ring a single shot from a single Basic Weapon with the Accurate Quality benefi ting from the Aim action, the attack gains an extra 1d10 Damage for every two Degrees of Success to a maximum of two extra 1d10. These extra d10s cannot generate Zealous Hatred. "
Balanced,"Some weapons, such as swords and knives, are designed so that the weight of the hilt balances the weight of the blade, making the weapon easier to wield. Balanced weapons grant a +10 bonus to Parry Tests when using this weapon. Even if the wielder is using multiple Balanced weapons, he only gains the bonus once. "
Blast (X),"Many missiles, grenades and some guns create an explosion when they hit their target. When working out a hit from a Blast weapon, anyone within the weapon’s blast radius in metres (indicated by the number in parenthesis) is also hit. Roll Damage once and apply it to each person affected by the blast. "
Concussive (X),"Some weapons create a deafening blast or shock wave when they hit. When target is struck by a Concussive weapon, must take a Toughness Test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parenthesis (X). For example a weapon with Concussive (2) would impose a –20 on Toughness Tests, and Concussive (0) would be a Test with no penalty. If he fails, target is stunned for 1 round per Degree of Failure. Additionally, if the target takes Damage greater than his Strength Bonus, the target is knocked Prone. "
Crippling (X),"Particularly cruel or deadly weapons sometimes include things like living barbs or shards that remain in their victims’ wounds causing them immense pain and even slowly killing them. When a target suffers at least one wound from this weapon they count as being “crippled” for the remainder of the encounter or until healed of all Damage. If a crippled character takes more than a Half Action on their turn, they suffer Rending Damage equal to the number in parenthesis (X). This Damage is not reduced by armour or Toughness. "
Defensive,"A Defensive weapon, such as a shield, is intended to be used to block attacks and is awkward when used for making attacks. Defensive weapons grant a +15 bonus to tests made when used to Parry, but take a –10 penalty when used to make attacks. "
Devastating (X),"If the target is a horde, a successful hit from this weapon reduces the Horde’s Magnitude by an additional amount equal to X. "
Felling (X),"To kill powerful foes often requires fearsome weapons or special rounds with the ability to punch through even the toughest hides. When calculating damage from Felling weapons, reduce the target’s Unnatural Toughness Bonus by the number in parenthesis (X). Felling only reduces Unnatural Toughness, not the target’s base Toughness Bonus. The reduction occurs for calculating Damage only, and does not persist. "
Flame,"Some weapons belch great gouts of flame, igniting anything they strike. If a target of a Flame attack is hit (even if he suffers no Damage), he must succeed on an Agility Test or be set on fire (see page 247). "
Flexible,"Some weapons are made up of a multitude of loosely connected segments, such as chains, while others, such as whips, are woven from supple hides. These kinds of weapons lash about when used to attack and cannot be Parried. "
Force,"Used exclusively by psykers, these weapons combine archeotech circuitry pattern with rare psycho-reactive crystals to channel their mental power into deadly, realityrending force. Force weapons can take many forms, and comprise several specialised variants, but are largely restricted to swords, staves, and axes. Any melee weapon with the Primitive Quality can be a Force weapon, and increases its Availability to Extremely Rare. Unless wielded by a psyker, Force weapons simply count as normal weapons of their type and are not considered to have the Force Quality. In the hands of a wielder with a Psy Rating, their true power is revealed. For every point of Psy Rating the wielder has, the weapon’s Damage and Penetration increase by +1. If the weapon possesses the Primitive Quality, it loses this Quality. For example, a Force sword wielded by a character with Psy Rating 3 would infl ict 1d10+3 (plus SB) and have a Penetration of 3. In addition to normal Damage, whenever a psyker Damages an opponent, he may, as a Free Action, channel psychic force and killing will into the blade. This requires a Focus Power Test using Opposed Willpower. For every Degree of Success, the Force weapon’s wielder deals an additional 1d10 E Damage, ignoring the victim’s Armour and Toughness Bonus. Force weapons cannot be destroyed by a power weapon’s field. "
Gyro-Stabilised,"The weapon has a small auto-stabilisation unit that is typically built towards the end of the barrel. While not as powerful as a suspensor, the gyro-stabiliser helps keep the weapon levelled at the optimal firing angle. A Gyro-Stabilised weapon never counts its target as being farther than Long Range (normal maximum range still applies). Heavy weapons with this Quality reduce the penalty for firing without Bracing to –20. "
Hallucinogenic (X),"Hallucinogenic weapons use drugs or mind-altering exotic energy to disorient or disable their targets, often inducing a variety of short-lived psychological states and delusions. When a creature takes a hit from a Hallucinogenic weapon it must make a Toughness Test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parenthesis (X) or suffer a temporary delusion and roll 1d100 on Table 5-1: Hallucinogenic Effects. Respirators and sealed armour provide a +20 bonus to this Test. The effects last for 1 Round, plus 1 additional Round for every Degree of Failure. "
Haywire (X),"Haywire weapons make use of microwaves or electromagnetic radiation to destroy the inner workings of machines and tech. Everything within the field’s radius, indicated by the number in parenthesis, is affected: Haywire (3) would affect an area with a three metre radius. Roll 1d100 on Table 5–2: Haywire Field Effects (adding any modifiers from the weapon) to determine the strength of the effect. As the field slowly dissipates, the strength lessens one step in severity each round until it becomes Insignificant (i.e., a result of Major Disruption would become Minor Disruption the following round and then cease to have an effect the round after that). Additional Haywire attacks in the same area do not stack but instead create a new effect that will either be ignored if lower than the current effect or replaced if higher. "
Inaccurate,Inaccurate weapons are either far too cumbersome to aim properly or lack any kind of reliable sights. These weapons never gain a bonus from Aiming. 
Maximal,"Maximal weapons have two fire settings allowing the wielder to either use the weapon at its lower setting to conserve ammo and allow a higher rate of fire, or make single powerful blasts requiring the weapon to recharge between shots. Before making an attack the user can choose to either fire the weapon normally, in which case it uses the profi le detailed on Table 5-3: Ranged Weapons, or to fire it on Maximal. When the weapon is fired on Maximal it adds 10 to its range, adds 1d10 to its Damage and +2 to its Penetration. If it has the Blast Quality then this is improved by +2, i.e., a weapon with Blast (3) become Blast (5). The weapon also uses three times the normal amount of ammo per shot and gains the Recharge Quality. "
Melta,"Using intense blasts of heat to excite particles and carve away armour, these weapons can slag even the hardest materials if fired from a close enough range. This weapon doubles its Penetration when firing at Short Range. "
Overheats,"Certain weapons are prone to overheating, either because of poor design or because they fire unstable superheated ammunition. An unmodifi ed roll to hit of 91 or higher causes the weapon to Overheat. When this happens the wielder immediately suffer a single hit from the weapon to his arm (left or right, depending on which hand he favours). Once the hit has been resolved the wielder must then make an Agility Test or drop the weapon as a Free Action. Whether or not the wielder drops the weapon, it must spend the following round cooling down and cannot be used. Weapons with this Special Quality never jam; and jam result indicates they Overheat instead. "
Power Field,"A field of power flickers around weapons with this Quality, increasing its Damage and Penetration. Such modifiers are already included in the weapon’s profile. When a character successfully uses this weapon to Parry an attack (or his own attack is parried) by a weapon without the Power Field, Natural Weapon, or Warp Weapon Quality or Trait, he has a 75% chance of destroying his attacker’s weapon. "
Primitive (X),"Crude and basic in design, these kinds of weapons, while still deadly, are less effective than more modern weapons. When rolling for Damage with these weapons, any dice roll greater than the number in parenthesis (X) counts as that number. For example a weapon with Primitive (7) would count all Damage rolls of 8, 9 or 0 as 7. These weapons still require a Damage score of 0 to generate Zealous Hatred as normal. "
Proven (X),"Weapons with a Proven Quality always infl ict massive trauma and treat any die roll for Damage lower than the Proven rating (as indicated by the number in parenthesis) as if it were the Proven rating instead. Thusly, a Proven (3) weapon would treat any die roll of 1 or 2 as a 3 for the purposes of calculating Damage. "
Razor Sharp,"Certain weapons or ammunition have the ability to slice right through armour if they hit just right. If the wielder scores three or more Degrees of Success when rolling to hit with this weapon, double this weapon’s Pen when resolving the hit. "
Recharge,"Because of the volatile nature of the weapon’s ammunition or due to the way it fires, the weapon needs time between shots to Recharge. The weapon must spend the Round after firing building up a charge and cannot be fired—in effect the character can only fire the weapon every other Round. "
Reliable,"Patterned on tried-and-true technology, Reliable weapons seldom fail. Reliable weapons only Jam on an unmodifi ed hit roll of 00. Reliable weapons with the Spray Quality or which do not make hit rolls never Jam. "
Sanctified,"These weapons are blessed against the forces of Chaos. Any Damage inflicted by a Sanctified weapon counts as Holy Damage. Holy damage does not have any integral effects, but works different against some Daemonic and Warp creatures (see page 140). "
Scatter,"The standard ammunition of these weapons spreads out when fired, hitting more of the target. At Point Blank Range this weapon gains a +10 to hit and inflicts an additional +3 Damage. At Short Range it gains an additional +10 to hit. At Long or Extreme Range it suffers –3 Damage (to a minimum of 0). "
Shocking,"Shocking weapons can Stun their opponents with a powerful surge of energy. A target that takes a hit from a Shocking weapon must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test. If he fails, he is Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to his Degrees of Failure. "
Smoke (X),"Rather than inflicting Damage, these weapons throw up dense clouds of smoke to create cover. When a hit is scored from a weapon with the Smoke Quality, it creates a smokescreen a number of metres in diameter from the point of impact equal to the number in parenthesis (X). This screen lasts for 1d10+10 Rounds, or less in adverse weather conditions (see the effects of Smoke on page 243). "
Spray,"Spray weapons project a cone of missiles, liquid or fi re out to the range of the weapon. Unlike other weapons, Spray weapons have just one range, and when fired, hit all those in their area of effect. The wielder does not need to Test Ballistic Skill; he simply fires the weapon. All creatures in the weapon’s path, a cone-shaped area extending in a 30-degree arc from the firer out to the weapon’s range, must make an Agility Test or be struck by the attack and take Damage normally. Cover does not protect characters from attacks made by Spray weapons unless it completely conceals them. Because Spray weapons make no roll to hit, they are always considered to hit targets in the body, and will Jam if the firer rolls a 9 on any of his Damage dice (before adding any bonuses). "
Snare (X),"Weapons with this Quality are designed to entangle enemies. On a successful hit, the target must make an Agility Test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parenthesis (X) or be immobilised. For example, a weapon with Snare (1) would impose a –10 on Agility Tests. An immobilised target can attempt no other actions except to try to escape the bonds. He can attempt to burst the bonds (a Strength Test) or wriggle free (an Agility Test) in his Turn. Both tests are made with the same penalty as the original test. The target is considered helpless until he escapes. "
Storm,"A weapon with the Storm Quality unleashes shots at rapid speed, often through use of a double-barrelled design. This Quality doubles the number of hits infl icted on the target and the amount of ammunition expended. For example, when firing a weapon with the Storm Quality in fully automatic mode, each degree of success yields two additional hits (to a maximum of twice the weapon’s Full Automatic rate of fire). "
Tearing,"Tearing weapons are vicious devices, often using multitudes of fast-moving jagged teeth to rip into flesh and bone or simply blasting massive wounds in fl esh. These weapons roll one extra die for Damage, discarding the lowest die rolled. "
Toxic (X),"Some weapons rely on toxins and poisons to do their damage. Anyone that takes Damage from a Toxic weapon, after reduction for armour and Toughness Bonus, must make a Toughness Test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parenthesis (X) or suffer an additional 1d10 points of Damage (of the same type as the weapon which inflicted the hit) not reduced by armour or Toughness. For example, a weapon with Toxic (4) would impose a –40 on Toughness Tests. Some weapons or creatures may carry additional effects with their toxins or inflict more Damage as indicated in their individual descriptions. "
Tainted,"These weapons are infused with the power of Chaos, and manifest the corruption in their bearer. Weapons with this Quality add their wielder’s Corruption Point Bonus (the 10s column of their Corruption Point total) to Damage dealt. "
Twin-Linked,A simple way to increase the firepower of a weapon is to strap two of them together! Twin-linked weapons represent two of the same kind of weapon fixed together and rigged to fire simultaneously with a single squeeze of the trigger. When firing a Twin-Linked weapon the wielder can choose to either gain a +10 to hit or an additional hit if they score at least one successful hit. Twin-Linked weapons expend twice their RoF in ammunition with each shot. 
Unbalanced,"Heavy and difficult to ready after an attack, these kinds of weapons impose a –10 penalty to any Parry Skill Tests when wielding this weapon. Unbalanced weapons cannot be used to make Lightning Attacks. "
Unreliable,"Certain weapons misfire more often than normal because they are badly maintained or constructed. An Unreliable weapon suffers a Jam on a roll of 91 or higher, even if fi red on Semior Full Auto. "
Unwieldy,"Huge and often top-heavy, Unwieldy weapons are too awkward to be used defensively. Unwieldy weapons cannot be used to Parry. Unwieldy weapons cannot be used to make Lightning Attacks. "
Warp Weapon,Rare weapons are sometimes composed of the raw power of the Warp or crafted with foul sorcery to hold its power and make them anathema to all living things. Warp weapons ignore Armour and the AP generated from cover. Force fields and armour specially warded work normally against them.
