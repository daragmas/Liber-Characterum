Hell Hammer Lascannon,Heavy,300,S/-/-,5d10+10,E,10,5,2 Full,Proven (3),55,Extremely Rare,Las,BC,Core,"A common variant of the man-portable lascannon used by the Imperial Guard, the Hell Hammer is a large bulky weapon that usually has a crew of two or three men, or one Traitor Legionnaire. Though it is awkward to wield, it can fire laser beams with enough force to punch through a battle tank."
Lasgun ,Basic ,100,S/3/– ,1d10+3,E,0,60,Full ,Reliable,4,Common,Las,BC,Core,"Produced in the trillions, the lasgun (created in hundreds of local and Imperial patterns) varies in shape and appearance but remains a reliable and functional infantry rifle. Thoughthere are more powerful weapons, few rival the lasgun’s dependability and robustness."
Laspistol,Pistol,30,S/2/-,1d10+2,E,0,30,Half,Reliable,1.5,Common,Las,BC,Core,"As common as the lasgun, the laspistol is the backup weapon of choice for both Imperial forces and many of their foes. It is a favoured sidearm for Imperial and Renegade officers alike, and shares the lasgun’s reliability. "
Las Carbine,Basic ,75,S/2/-,1d10+3,E,0,60,Half,Reliable,2.5,Common,Las,BC,Core,"A cut-down version of the lasgun, the las carbine makes a good backup weapon, often given to vehicle crews or support staff. Their smaller construction (they have shorter barrels and often come with folding stocks) mean they are popular with those who wish to carry a concealed weapon as well. Las carbines can be fi red with one hand at only a –10 penalty, rather than the normal –20 penalty for basic weapons."
Long-Las,Basic ,150,S/-/-,1d10+3,E,1,40,Full ,"Accurate, Reliable, Felling (4)",4.5,Scarce,Las,BC,Core,"Favoured by snipers, the long-las is a specially modifi ed version of the lasgun constructed for added range and accuracy. As it’s name implies, a long-las has a much longer barrel than a lasgun, both to increase range and prevent overheating."
M41 Multilaser,Heavy,150,-/-/5,2d10+10,E,2,100,2 Full,Reliable,35,Very Rare,Las,BC,Core,"Often found mounted on vehicles as a counter to infantry and light vehicles, the multi-laser is a multi-barrelled gatling laser with an impressive rate of fi re. However, its blasts lack the penetration of the lascannon, making it less effective against heavy armour."
Armoured Gauntlet,Melee,,,1d5+1,I,0,,,Primitive (6),1,Average,Primary,BC,Core,These simple metallic gloves are worn over the hand to allow a degree of protection and to add to combat damage. Sometimes they include small spikes or cutting edges to further increase the blood shed by each blow. This is a onehanded melee weapon.
Legion Combat Knife,Melee,,,1d10,R,2,,,-,2,Very Rare,Primary,BC,Core,"A formidable weapon and one that only the great warriors of the Chaos Space Marines would call a mere knife—if it were not for the too-wide grip, humans could use these impressive blades as swords. Tough and thick, these knives are designed for in-close fi ghting and stabbing and are often the last weapon a Space Marine will use when all else has run out of ammunition or power. This is a Legion weapon and follows all the rules for the use of Legion weapons. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Axe,Melee,,,1d10+1,R,0,,,Unwieldy,4,Average,Primary,BC,Core,"Many a Heretic will swear their axe is their most prized weapon, valuing its simplicity and brutality. With each strike they can fully express their hatred of the Imperium, with each cleave they chop away at the hypocrisy and failure maintained by the its deluded followers. This is a one-handed melee weapon"
Knife,"Melee, Thrown",,,1d5,R,0,,,-,1,Plentiful,Primary,BC,Core,"Few warriors use a knife as their primary weapon, but fewer indeed would ever be caught without at least one of them as a backup. Most hive gangers wouldn’t feel appropriately dressed without at least three on their person, and those who seek discretion prefer at least one secreted away should problems ensue. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
