Hell Hammer Lascannon,Heavy,300m,S/–/–,5d10+10,E,10,5,2 Full,Proven (3),55kg,Extremely Rare,Las,Core,"A common variant of the man-portable lascannon used by the Imperial Guard, the Hell Hammer is a large bulky weapon that usually has a crew of two or three men, or one Traitor Legionnaire. Though it is awkward to wield, it can fire laser beams with enough force to punch through a battle tank."
Lasgun,Basic,100m,S/3/–,1d10+3,E,0,60,Full,Reliable,4kg,Common,Las,Core,"Produced in the trillions, the lasgun (created in hundreds of local and Imperial patterns) varies in shape and appearance but remains a reliable and functional infantry rifle. Thoughthere are more powerful weapons, few rival the lasgun’s dependability and robustness."
Laspistol,Pistol,30m,S/2/–,1d10+2,E,0,30,Half,Reliable,1.5kg,Common,Las,Core,"As common as the lasgun, the laspistol is the backup weapon of choice for both Imperial forces and many of their foes. It is a favoured sidearm for Imperial and Renegade officers alike, and shares the lasgun’s reliability."
Las Carbine,Basic,75m,S/2/–,1d10+3,E,0,60,Half,Reliable,2.5kg,Common,Las,Core,"A cut-down version of the lasgun, the las carbine makes a good backup weapon, often given to vehicle crews or support staff. Their smaller construction (they have shorter barrels and often come with folding stocks) mean they are popular with those who wish to carry a concealed weapon as well. Las carbines can be fi red with one hand at only a –10 penalty, rather than the normal –20 penalty for basic weapons."
Long-Las,Basic,150m,S/–/–,1d10+3,E,1,40,Full,"Accurate, Reliable, Felling (4)",4.5kg,Scarce,Las,Core,"Favoured by snipers, the long-las is a specially modifi ed version of the lasgun constructed for added range and accuracy. As it’s name implies, a long-las has a much longer barrel than a lasgun, both to increase range and prevent overheating."
M41 Multilaser,Heavy,150m,–/–/5,2d10+10,E,2,100,2 Full,Reliable,35kg,Very Rare,Las,Core,"Often found mounted on vehicles as a counter to infantry and light vehicles, the multi-laser is a multi-barrelled gatling laser with an impressive rate of fi re. However, its blasts lack the penetration of the lascannon, making it less effective against heavy armour."
Autogun,Basic,100m,S/3/10,1d10+3,I,0,30,Full,—,5kg,Average,SP,Core,"Autoguns are cheap and easy to produce weapons, popular when lasguns are not available. A typical weapon may not be incredibly accurate or as reliable as a lasgun, but will make up for it with a high rate of fire and cheap ammunition. Most autoguns fire solid low-calibre slugs from standardised clips, and the design is ubiquitous enough that many xenos have their own variants."
Autopistol,Pistol,30m,S/–/6,1d10+2,I,0,18,Full,—,1.5kg,Average,SP,Core,"A common weapon for hivers and scum, the autopistol is a pistol capable of a high rate of fire and access to a variety of ammo types."
Assault Shotgun,Basic,30m,S/3/–,1d10+4,I,0,12,2 Full,Scatter,5.5kg,Scarce,SP,Core,"The assault shotgun is a combat-ready version of the standard pump-action shotgun. The ability to fire on semi-auto makes the assault shotgun a dangerous weapon, able to fill entire rooms with a hail of indiscriminate and deadly buckshot."
Bow,Basic,40m,S/–/–,1d10,R,0,1,Half,"Primitive (6), Reliable",2kg,Plentiful,SP,Core,"One of the oldest weapons in civilisation, bows can range from primitive constructions of wood and sinew to weapons made from fine composites and wire micro-fibres. Their primary utility is silence, as they are relatively ineffective compared to modern weapons."
Crossbow,Basic,30m,S/–/–,1d10+1,R,0,1,2 Full,"Primitive (7), Simple Operation",3kg,Average,SP,Core,"This slightly more sophisticated version of the bow uses a stock and winch to increase tension and fi re a bolt or quarrel over a longer distance. These weapons can be used even by the unskilled, which is their primary selling point."
Flintlock Pistol,Pistol,15m,S/–/–,1d10+2,I,0,1,3 Full,"Primitive (8), Innacurate, Unreliable",3kg,Common,SP,Core,"Flintlock weapons are precursors to modern firearms, muzzle-loading single-shot black powder weapons with limited accuracy and short range. Amongst the feral tribes that populate the savage worlds of the Vortex, such weapons may be considered a sign of status. However, against power armour (and even the flak armour of the Imperial Guard) such weapons are woefully ineffective."
Flintlock Musket,Basic,30m,S/–/–,1d10+3,I,0,1,5 Full,"Primitive (8), Innacurate, Unreliable",7kg,Common,SP,Core,"Flintlock weapons are precursors to modern firearms, muzzle-loading single-shot black powder weapons with limited accuracy and short range. Amongst the feral tribes that populate the savage worlds of the Vortex, such weapons may be considered a sign of status. However, against power armour (and even the flak armour of the Imperial Guard) such weapons are woefully ineffective."
Hand Cannon,Pistol,35m,S/–/–,1d10+4,I,2,5,2 Full,Massive Recoil,3kg,Scarce,SP,Core,"A heavier version of the stub gun, hand cannons are popular with those who have the arm strength to wield them. They fire massive slugs that can turn unfortunates into chunks of meat, but generally have a low rate of fire and small ammo capacity."
Harpoon Gun,Heavy,40m,S/–/–,2d10+2,R,0,1,4 Full,"Crippling (5), Primitive (9), Snare (1)",18kg,Scarce,SP,Core,"This projectile weapon fires a long, barbed spear attached to a rope or chain, allowing the operator to reel in a helpless target. Such weapons are popular amongst the reavers in pirate wolfpacks, as they can be used as impromptu boarding devices or to maim a victim then pull them close for a “personal kill.” If a target is snared by a Harpoon Gun, the operator can make an Opposed Strength Test with the target as a Full Action on his next turn. If he succeeds, he pulls the target a number of metres directly towards him equal to the Degrees of Success."
Heavy Stubber,Heavy,100m,–/–/8,1d10+5,I,3,75,2 Full,,30kg,Rare,SP,Core,"The heavy stubber is a popular weapon amongst military forces and gangers alike, as—like most solid projectile weaponry—they are easily maintained and reasonably reliable. Heavy stubbers are large, belt-fed heavy weapons, often with long vented barrels. Though not as devastating as a heavy bolter or autocannon, they lay down an impressive rate of fi re and can shred infantry and unarmoured vehicles. Heavy stubbers are typically employed with a bipod or tripod mount to avoid the punishing recoil, though some tough individuals may be able to carry them with extensive bracing harnesses or suspensors. Many patterns use an ammunition belt of 100 rounds, though this often requires a loader to ensure the feed doesn’t jam. However, heavy stubbers can also be purchased with a smaller drum magazine of 40 rounds that does not require a loader."
Legion Shotgun,Basic,30m,S/2/–,1d10+6,I,0,10,2 Full,"Reliable, Scatter",10kg,Very Rare,SP,Core,"Shotguns fire a smoothbore cartridge full of pellets (though some Heretics prefer to fill the cartridge with wire twists or even glass shards for particularly painful wounds), so one shot fires a high-speed cloud of lead. These robust and practical weapons are popular amongst pirate raiders and underhive enforcers, as they can wreak havoc in close quarters. Some shotguns are specifically designed to be used by Space Marines, although most of these were originally possessed by the Space Marine Scouts of loyalist Chapters and 'requisitioned' by the Traitor Legionnaires."
M34 Autocannon,Heavy,300m,S/3/–,3d10+8,I,6,20,2 Full,Reliable,40kg,Very Rare,SP,Core,"An autocannon is a crew-served heavy weapon, a self-loading high calibre cannon that uses dense solid shells to punch through armour. Though unable to fully penetrate the ceramite of Space Marine power armour, they decimate light to medium vehicles and see widespread use in the Imperial Guard and many renegade armies. The M34 autocannon is an older version of a common Imperial Guard pattern in the Jericho Reach, and uses a tripod mount. It can be manned by one person, though it ideally employs a crew of two to move and set up."
Reaper Autocannon,Heavy,300m,S/4/–,3d10+8,I,6,40,2 Full,"Reliable, Twin-Linked",60kg,Extremely Rare,SP,Core,"The Reaper Autocannon is a particular type of double-barrelled autocannon, no longer employed by the forces of the Emperor. It is often seen amongst the ranks of Chaos Terminators, who use the heavy volume of fire it lays down to great effect, giving warbands an ability to take out heavy troops and light armour at range."
Shotgun,Basic,30m,S/–/–,1d10+4,I,0,8,2 Full,Scatter,5kg,Plentiful,SP,Core,"Shotguns fire a smoothbore cartridge full of pellets (though some Heretics prefer to fill the cartridge with wire twists or even glass shards for particularly painful wounds), so one shot fires a high-speed cloud of lead. These robust and practical weapons are popular amongst pirate raiders and underhive enforcers, as they can wreak havoc in close quarters."
Stub Automatic,Pistol,30m,S/3/–,1d10+3,I,0,9,Full,—,1.5kg,Average,SP,Core,"The stub automatic fires larger-bore projectiles than the autopistol, in single shot or semi-auto modes. Like other solid projectile weapons, its primary advantages are that its cheap and easy to maintain."
Stub Revolver,Pistol,30m,S/–/–,1d10+3,I,0,6,2 Full,Reliable,1.5kg,Plentiful,SP,Core,"The stub revolver is an ancient pistol design, using a revolving chamber to hold stub rounds. Though the design is exceedingly primitive, it survives because it is also exceedingly reliable—with few moving parts and a simple loading mechanism."
Stub Rifle,Basic,120m,S/–/–,1d10+3,I,1,5,Full,Accurate,5.5kg,Average,SP,Core,"The stub rifl e is a common sight across the galaxy, a hunting rifle fi ring large-bore stub rounds. Like most solid projectile weapons, its primary benefit is ease of construction and maintenance. Though dismissed as a pitiful civilian weapon by some, the accuracy of a stub rifle means many rebellions begin with one well-placed shot to an Imperial official’s head."
Bolter,Basic,100m,S/3/–,1d10+5,X,4,24,Full,Tearing,7kg,Very Rare,Bolt,Core,"The boltgun (also referred to as a “bolter”) is a powerful weapon that confers much prestige to the wielder. Many are heirloom weapons, taken in ritual duels or armed conflicts and passed down through generations of owners. This version of bolter is designed to be used by an un-augmented human, although the recoil is still murderous."
Bolt Pistol,Pistol,30m,S/2/–,1d10+5,X,4,8,Full,Tearing,3.5kg,Very Rare,Bolt,Core,"Large and intimidating pistols capable of decapitating a man with a single shot, bolt pistols are rare outside of elite Imperial forces, officer cadres of armies, or especially skilled or resourceful Heretics. This version of the bolt pistol is designed to be used by an un-augmented human, giving the lucky bearer superior fi repower at his hip."
Combi-Bolter,Basic,80m,S/3/–,1d10+5,X,4,32,2 Full,"Tearing, Twin-Linked",12kg,Extremely Rare,Bolt,Core,"The combi-bolter is a precursor to the Imperial storm bolter— essentially two bolters welded together with a linked firing mechanism. The result is an unwieldy and heavy weapon, but one that possesses an impressive rate of fire."
Heavy Bolter,Heavy,150m,–/–/6,1d10+8,X,5,60,Full,Tearing,40kg,Very Rare,Bolt,Core,"The heavy bolter is a common weapon amongst the armed forces of the Imperium, and over the last ten millennia has become a common weapon in the hands of the Imperium’s enemies as well. The fully automatic, tripod or bipod-mounted weapon spews out a torrent of massreactive bolts with a much higher calibre than regular boltgun ammo. The armour-penetrating explosive rounds can destroy vehicles and make mincemeat out of even heavy infantry."
Legion Bolter,Basic,100m,S/3/–,1d10+9,X,4,24,Full,Tearing,10kg,Extremely Rare,Bolt,Core,"Just as the Adeptus Astartes of the Imperium wield weapons beyond the heft of mere mortals, so to do the Traitor Legions arm themselves with larger bolt weapons that fi re far more powerful rounds. Those of the Chaos Space Marines are often true relic weapons, possibly even left over from the Heresy itself, and thus are possessed by ancient and murderous machine spirits. The blood-thirst of their weapons is kept in check only by the formidable will of their fearsome masters. The Legion boltgun, bolt pistol, combi-bolter, and heavy bolter share many design similarities with their non-Legion variations, the most sizeable difference being the more powerful rounds and more reliable mechanisms. They also count as Legion weapons, and thus follow the rules concerning non-Legionaires wielding Traitor Legion weapons."
