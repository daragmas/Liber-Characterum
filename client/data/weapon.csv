Hell Hammer Lascannon,Heavy,300,S/-/-,5d10+10,E,10,5,2 Full,Proven (3),55,Extremely Rare,Las,BC,Core,"A common variant of the man-portable lascannon used by the Imperial Guard, the Hell Hammer is a large bulky weapon that usually has a crew of two or three men, or one Traitor Legionnaire. Though it is awkward to wield, it can fire laser beams with enough force to punch through a battle tank."
Lasgun,Basic,100,S/3/–,1d10+3,E,0,60,Full ,Reliable,4,Common,Las,BC,Core,"Produced in the trillions, the lasgun (created in hundreds of local and Imperial patterns) varies in shape and appearance but remains a reliable and functional infantry rifle. Thoughthere are more powerful weapons, few rival the lasgun’s dependability and robustness."
Laspistol,Pistol,30,S/2/-,1d10+2,E,0,30,Half,Reliable,1.5,Common,Las,BC,Core,"As common as the lasgun, the laspistol is the backup weapon of choice for both Imperial forces and many of their foes. It is a favoured sidearm for Imperial and Renegade officers alike, and shares the lasgun’s reliability. "
Las Carbine,Basic,75,S/2/-,1d10+3,E,0,60,Half,Reliable,2.5,Common,Las,BC,Core,"A cut-down version of the lasgun, the las carbine makes a good backup weapon, often given to vehicle crews or support staff. Their smaller construction (they have shorter barrels and often come with folding stocks) mean they are popular with those who wish to carry a concealed weapon as well. Las carbines can be fi red with one hand at only a –10 penalty, rather than the normal –20 penalty for basic weapons."
Long-Las,Basic,150,S/-/-,1d10+3,E,1,40,Full ,"Accurate, Reliable, Felling (4)",4.5,Scarce,Las,BC,Core,"Favoured by snipers, the long-las is a specially modifi ed version of the lasgun constructed for added range and accuracy. As it’s name implies, a long-las has a much longer barrel than a lasgun, both to increase range and prevent overheating."
M41 Multilaser,Heavy,150,-/-/5,2d10+10,E,2,100,2 Full,Reliable,35,Very Rare,Las,BC,Core,"Often found mounted on vehicles as a counter to infantry and light vehicles, the multi-laser is a multi-barrelled gatling laser with an impressive rate of fi re. However, its blasts lack the penetration of the lascannon, making it less effective against heavy armour."
Armoured Gauntlet,Melee,,,1d5+1,I,0,,,Primitive (6),1,Average,Primary,BC,Core,These simple metallic gloves are worn over the hand to allow a degree of protection and to add to combat damage. Sometimes they include small spikes or cutting edges to further increase the blood shed by each blow. This is a onehanded melee weapon.
Legion Combat Knife,Melee,,,1d10,R,2,,,,2,Very Rare,Primary,BC,Core,"A formidable weapon and one that only the great warriors of the Chaos Space Marines would call a mere knife—if it were not for the too-wide grip, humans could use these impressive blades as swords. Tough and thick, these knives are designed for in-close fi ghting and stabbing and are often the last weapon a Space Marine will use when all else has run out of ammunition or power. This is a Legion weapon and follows all the rules for the use of Legion weapons. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Axe,Melee,,,1d10+1,R,0,,,Unwieldy,4,Average,Primary,BC,Core,"Many a Heretic will swear their axe is their most prized weapon, valuing its simplicity and brutality. With each strike they can fully express their hatred of the Imperium, with each cleave they chop away at the hypocrisy and failure maintained by the its deluded followers. This is a one-handed melee weapon"
Knife,"Melee, Thrown",,,1d5,R,0,,,,1,Plentiful,Primary,BC,Core,"Few warriors use a knife as their primary weapon, but fewer indeed would ever be caught without at least one of them as a backup. Most hive gangers wouldn’t feel appropriately dressed without at least three on their person, and those who seek discretion prefer at least one secreted away should problems ensue. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Legion Shotgun,Basic,30,S/2/–,1d10+6,I,0,2,Full ,"Reliable, Scatter",10,Very Rare,Solid,BC,Core,"Shotguns fire a smoothbore cartridge full of pellets (though some Heretics prefer to fi ll the cartridge with wire twists or even glass shards for particularly painful wounds), so one shot fires a high-speed cloud of lead. These robust and practical weapons are popular amongst pirate raiders and underhive enforcers, as they can wreak havoc in close quarters. Some shotguns are specifically designed to be used by Space Marines, although most of these were originally possessed by the Space Marine Scouts of loyalist Chapters and “requisitioned” by the Traitor Legionnaires."
Legion Bolter,Basic,100,S/3/– ,1d10+9,X,4,35,Full ,Tearing,10,Extremely Rare,Bolt,BC,Core,"Just as the Adeptus Astartes of the Imperium wield weapons beyond the heft of mere mortals, so to do the Traitor Legions arm themselves with larger bolt weapons that fi re far more powerful rounds. Those of the Chaos Space Marines are often true relic weapons, possibly even left over from the Heresy itself, and thus are possessed by ancient and murderous machine spirits. The blood-thirst of their weapons is kept in check only by the formidable will of their fearsome masters. The Legion boltgun, bolt pistol, combi-bolter, and heavy bolter share many design similarities with their non-Legion variations, the most sizeable difference being the more powerful rounds and more reliable mechanisms. They also count as Legion weapons, and thus follow the rules concerning non-Legionaires wielding Traitor Legion weapons."
Legion Bolt Pistol,Pistol,30,S/2/-,1d10+9,X,4,8,Full ,Tearing,5.5,Extremely Rare,Bolt,BC,Core,"Just as the Adeptus Astartes of the Imperium wield weapons beyond the heft of mere mortals, so to do the Traitor Legions arm themselves with larger bolt weapons that fi re far more powerful rounds. Those of the Chaos Space Marines are often true relic weapons, possibly even left over from the Heresy itself, and thus are possessed by ancient and murderous machine spirits. The blood-thirst of their weapons is kept in check only by the formidable will of their fearsome masters. The Legion boltgun, bolt pistol, combi-bolter, and heavy bolter share many design similarities with their non-Legion variations, the most sizeable difference being the more powerful rounds and more reliable mechanisms. They also count as Legion weapons, and thus follow the rules concerning non-Legionaires wielding Traitor Legion weapons."
Bolter,Basic,100,S/3/– ,1d10+5,X,4,24,Full ,Tearing,7,Very Rare,Bolt,BC,Core,"The boltgun (also referred to as a “bolter”) is a powerful weapon that confers much prestige to the wielder. Many are heirloom weapons, taken in ritual duels or armed conflicts and passed down through generations of owners. This version of bolter is designed to be used by an un-augmented human, although the recoil is still murderous."
Bolt Pistol,Pistol,30,S/2/-,1d10+5,X,4,8,Full ,Tearing,3.5,Very Rare,Bolt,BC,Core,"Large and intimidating pistols capable of decapitating a man with a single shot, bolt pistols are rare outside of elite Imperial forces, officer cadres of armies, or especially skilled or resourceful Heretics. This version of the bolt pistol is designed to be used by an un-augmented human, giving the lucky bearer superior fi repower at his hip."
Plasma Gun,Basic,90,S/2/-,1d10+8,E,10,20,5 Full,"Maximal, Overload",18,Very Rare,Plasma,BC,Core,"The plasma gun is potent weapon capable of punching a glowing hole in almost any target, though they are dangerous to use and difficult to find. The ravaging energies held in check by the magnetic containment fields sometimes burst from their restraints and pour out of the weapon’s specialised cooling vents. Though the weapon itself remains intact, the unfortunate wielding it often does not prove as lucky. However, plasma weapons are so rare and valued it’s often better that the weapon survive than the wielder."
Heavy Flamer,Heavy,30,S/-/-,1d10+8,E,5,10,2 Full,"Flame, Spray",20,Rare,Flame,BC,Core,"The heavy flamer is a larger and more cumbersome version of the flamer. It is often mounted on vehicles, though it is just reasonable enough in size to be carried by an individual trooper. Any lack of accuracy is more than offset by the wide gout of burning promethium that is almost impossible to dodge. Heavy flamers must be fuelled by backpack fuel canisters— the weight is already part of the weapon profile, but again, the canister must be worn on the user’s back."
Chainsword,Melee,,,1d10+2,R,2,,,"Tearing, Balanced",6,Average,Chain,BC,Core,"As the name suggests, chainswords are roughly sword-like in shape with a large flat housing containing the chain. Chainsword variants often used by Chaos followers often have the entire blade chassis opened to expose the chained teeth. This makes the weapon more dangerous to both user and victim, but for a truly dedicated warrior this is of little concern. Like all their weapons, the chainswords used by Legion forces are longer and heavier, fi t only to be carried by these mightiest of warriors. The Legion variant is a Legion weapon and follows all the rules for the use of Legion weapons. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Power Mace,Melee,,,1d10+6,E,4,,,"Power Field, Concussive (0)",8,Extremely Rare,Power,BC,Core,"Developed early in the Crusades, the power mace was a simple adoption of the newly rediscovered power field technologies. Each is a relatively straightforward construction with a thumb activator in the haft to energise the weapon; once powered the mace can strike blows of impressive force. Many variants such as the Deimospattern Virge weapon included symmetrical flanges of spiked adamantium to better penetrate armour. This is a one-handed melee weapon. However, when used with two hands, it gains the Concussive (0) Quality."
Stub Revolver,Pistol,30,S/-/-,1d10+3,I,0,6,2 Full,Reliable,1.5,Plentiful,Solid,BC,Core,"The stub revolver is an ancient pistol design, using a revolving chamber to hold stub rounds. Though the design is exceedingly primitive, it survives because it is also exceedingly reliable—with few moving parts and a simple loading mechanism."
Sword,Melee,,,1d10,R,0,,,Balanced,3,Common,Primary,BC,Core,"The generic name for the basic hand-blade, the sword is perhaps the most widely used melee weapon. Relatively easy to manufacture, even untrained fighters can carry one into combat with some measure of success. Swords can range from mass-produced blades of cheap metal to lightweight plasteel, with elaborate versions made from Tyranid talons or petrified bones. However, as with most melee weapons, it is more the skill of the user than the actual weapon that determines the winner of the conflict. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Neural Whip,Melee,3,,1d10+1,R,0,,,"Flexible, Shocking",4,Rare,Shock,BC,Core,"Neural whips are more often used to kill opponents via painful lacerations. Each resembles a normal whip, but with thicker, metallic lines and larger heavy-impact weights at the end of each cord. Even without the charge, lashes can rip open flesh or tear apart primitive armours. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Power Axe,Melee,,,1d10+7,E,6,,,"Power Field, Unbalanced",8,Extremely Rare,Power,BC,Core,"These weapons are a favourite of many elite assault squads, for while somewhat unwieldy to use they can hack apart most foes in a single strike. Even when not wreathed in their glowing power-field energies they make for a formidable weapon. Legion variants are as intimidating and deadly as their wielders, capable of slicing a foe in two with ease. The Legion variant is a Legion weapon and follows all the rules for the use of Legion weapons. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Great Weapon,Melee,,,2d10,,0,,,Unbalanced,7,Scarce,Primary,BC,Core,"The catchall term for the larger and heavier version of most melee weapons, these require two hands unless the user has exceptional strength. Be they giant axes, massive hammers, or even huge swords, they all are exceptionally brutal weapons that infl ict serious damage with each strike. This is a two-handed melee weapon."
Power Blade,Melee,,,1d10+3,E,5,,,Power Field,3,Very Rare,Power,BC,Core,"Easily concealable, these small knives are invaluable for infiltration missions where more obvious weapons would be impractical. Commonly they take the form of thin daggers and rely on the strength of their power field to maintain the integrity of the blade when used to strike. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Legion Power Sword,Melee,,,1d10+6,E,6,,,"Power Field, Balanced",5,Extremely Rare,Power,BC,Core,"Often the signature weapons of elite warriors, power swords are perhaps the most dangerous of melee weapons. In the hands of skilled swordsman, they combine a deadly offence with a nearly impenetrable defence. They come in a variety of shapes and styles, and entire schools are devoted to their mastery. The Legion variant is a Legion weapon and follows all the rules for the use of Legion weapons. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Legion Chainsword,Melee,,,1d10+3,R,3,,,"Tearing, Balanced",10,Extremely Rare,Chain,BC,Core,"As the name suggests, chainswords are roughly sword-like in shape with a large flat housing containing the chain. Chainsword variants often used by Chaos followers often have the entire blade chassis opened to expose the chained teeth. This makes the weapon more dangerous to both user and victim, but for a truly dedicated warrior this is of little concern. Like all their weapons, the chainswords used by Legion forces are longer and heavier, fi t only to be carried by these mightiest of warriors. The Legion variant is a Legion weapon and follows all the rules for the use of Legion weapons. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Force Rod,Melee,,,1d5,I,0,,,Force,1,Near Unique,Force,BC,Core,A stick with extra bonking power
Force Scythe,Melee,,,1d10+4,R,3,,,"Unbalanced, Force",10,Near Unique,Force,BC,Core,A weapon for psykers looking to look extra edgy
Force Staff,Melee,,,1d10,I,0,,,"Balanced, Force",4,Near Unique,Force,BC,Core,"Like force rods, a force staff can pass as a harmless item that would not cause alarm, appearing to the naked eye to be a simple walking stick. More ostentatious psykers, however, carry staffs with elaborate ornamentation (typically depicting their patron god), the better to announce their presence. A force staff also act as a Psy-Focus (see page 186) as long as it is gripped with one hand (though like all staves, two hands are needed to properly use it as a weapon). This is a two-handed melee weapon."
Force Sword,Melee,,,1d10+2,R,2,,,"Balanced, Force",8,Near Unique,Force,BC,Core,"Appearing to be a simple but unusually coloured or etched blade, a force sword allows a well-trained psyker to fully channel his mental and martial abilities in combat. It is the mark of a truly powerful psyker to carry one and use it skillfully. This is a one-handed melee weapon."
Legion Frag Grenade,Thrown,SBx3,,2d10+2,X,0,1,,"Blast (4)",0.7,Scarce,Grenade,BC,Core,"A Traitor Legionnaire can carry larger and more potent explosive grenades than a regular human, though many of them utilise regular grenades when supplies are hard to find. Legion Frag and Krak grenades follow all the rules for Legion weapons."
