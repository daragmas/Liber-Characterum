Name,Description,System,Book
Amphibious,"The creature can breathe water as well as air and can stay underwater indefinitely without the need to surface. If this trait is taken by a creature with the ability to breathe a substance other than air (i.e. water, ammonia, carbon-dioxide etc) then it can breathe air as well as its native atmosphere.",BC,Core
Amorphous,"An amorphous creature which has a malleable form, capable of squeezing its body or expanding it. It can change size by one-step in either direction, though doing so does not change its speed. Creatures with this trait determine their movement rates using one-half their Agility Bonus rounded up. Amorphous creatures are often missing senses and so rely on the Unnatural Senses Trait to perceive their surroundings.",BC,Core
Auto-Stabilized,The creature always counts as braced when firing heavy weapons and therefore may fire a ranged weapon on full or semi-automatic without taking the Brace action first without suffering any penalties to hit.,BC,Core
Bestial,"A creature with this trait is animalistic, tending to behave instinctively rather than rationally. No matter how high its Intelligence score is, it is still bestial. A creature with this trait never needs to make a Survival Skill Test whilst in its natural habitat. Unless starving or desperate, a bestial creature must make a Willpower Test when frightened, startled or injured. On a failed test, the creature flees.",BC,Core
Blind,"Blind creatures automatically fail all tests based on vision and automatically fail all Ballistic Skill Tests. Such creatures take a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and most other tests that ordinarily involve or are benefited by vision. Note that this Trait indicates not only that the creature cannot see but that it also has no other senses which would provide the same benefit as eyes. The Blind Fighting Talent reduces the penalties to Weapon Skill Tests as normal for Blind creatures, reducing it from –30 to –15.",BC,Core
Brutal Charge (X),A creature with this trait deals an extra (X) points of damage per attack when it charges in the same round.,BC,Core
Burrower (X),"A creature with this trait can move through solid objects by burrowing through them. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when burrowing. Such creatures can burrow through soil, rock, sand, and so on, though some (expressed in the creature entry) can burrow through metal. When a creature burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel. Creatures of one-size smaller than the creature that created the tunnel can enter these areas without impediment. There’s a 50% chance each round that the tunnel collapses behind the creature.",BC,Core
Crawler,"Worms, serpents, and similar creatures crawl and slither rather than walk. The base move for a creature with this trait is half their normal movement rate (round up) as determined by their Agility Bonus, but they do not take penalties for moving over difficult terrain.",BC,Core
Daemonic (X),"Daemonic creatures are creatures of the warp, but can manifest in real space either through sheer strength of will, hunger, or occult rituals. Creatures with this trait increase their Toughness Bonus against all Damage by the number indicated in the parenthesis (X) in the same manner as an Unnatural Characteristic (see Unnatural Characteristics trait on page 144). The effects of this trait stack with the effects of the Unnatural Characteristic trait. This increase is negated by Damage inflicted by force weapons, psychic powers, holy attacks, or other creatures with this trait. Daemonic creatures are also immune to poison and disease. Creatures with the Daemonic trait also gain benefits when using Psychic Powers as detailed in Chapter VI: The Powers of the Warp.",BC,Core
Dark-Sight,"A creature with this trait sees normally even in areas of total darkness, and never takes a penalty for fighting in areas of dim or no lighting.",BC,Core
Fear (X),"A creature with this trait has an unnerving appearance. The fear of it always has an associated rating (1–4) to reflect just how awful the creature is to behold and is indicated by the number in parenthesis (X). The higher the Fear Rating the harder it is for others to resist going encounter, as shown on Table 4-7: Fear Ratings. When a character encounters a creature with this Trait, they must make a Willpower Test, modified by the severity of the creature’s trait. On a success, the character may act as normal. On a failure, the character must roll on Table 8-4: Shock (see page 277), adding +10 to the roll for every Degree of Failure by which the Willpower Test was failed.",BC,Core
Flyer (X),"A creature with this trait has the natural ability to fly, whether with broad leathery wings, strange Warp energies, or inflatable gas sacs. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when flying. This number replaces the creature’s Agility Bonus for movement Actions. For more details on flying, see Chapter I: Playing the Game.",BC,Core
From Beyond,"The mind of a creature with this trait is beyond the petty frailties and precarious sanity of a mortal mind. It is immune to Fear, Pinning, Insanity Points, and psychic powers used to cloud, control, or delude its minds.",BC,Core
Deadly Natural Weapons,"This creature’s natural attacks are powerful enough to crush plasteel or punch through armour. The creature gains all the benefits of the Natural Weapons Trait, except that its attacks no longer have the Primitive Special Quality.",BC,Core
Hoverer (X),"Creatures with this trait have a limited capability for flight, flying no higher than two metres. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when hovering. This number replaces its Agility Bonus for purposes of calculating Movement. For more details on flying, see Chapter I: Playing the Game.",BC,Core
Incorporeal,"Incorporeal creatures are insubstantial and weightless, able to pass through solid objects such as walls and weapons. An incorporeal creature gains a +30 bonus on Stealth Tests due to their ability to merge with objects and the fact they make practically no sounds when they move. Incorporeal creatures gain the Hoverer (6) trait. An incorporeal creature is also immune to normal weapons—they simply pass through its body as if it wasn’t there. Daemons, psychic powers, warp creatures, other incorporeal creatures, and opponents armed with force weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An incorporeal creature can’t normally affect the mortal world, and thus can’t Damage non-incorporeal opponents unless it has a suitable special ability or Talent. Creatures with the Incorporeal trait can Damage other creatures with the Incorporeal trait normally. Certain devices can keep an incorporeal creature at bay, most notably the Gellar Field of a spaceship. Creatures with this trait cannot pass through such a field.",BC,Core
Machine (X),"A creature with the Machine trait is fashioned from inorganic materials and is generally more rigorous then fleshy folks. Machines do not breathe, are immune to the effects of a vacuum, extremes of cold, any mind-influencing psychic effect, and their Armour Points apply toward fire Damage. Machines have a certain number of Armour Points (indicated by the number in parentheses). This armour stacks with worn armour, but not with the Natural Armour Trait.",BC,Core
Multiple Arms (X),"This creature has more than one pair of arms. The exact number of arms is indicated in parenthesis (X), so a Genestealer with Multiple Arms (4) has four arms total. It gains a +10 bonus on Athletics Tests involving climbing and swimming. In addition, for each pair of arms it has—the Multiple Arms value divided by 2—it may make an additional attack as if wielding multiple melee weapons (the creature must either have natural weapons or actual melee weapons to wield for this to take effect). Note, that a creature still requires Two Weapon Wielder (Melee) to make multiple attacks in the same turn.",BC,Core
Natural Armour (X),"This creature has a naturally tough hide or an exoskeleton, affording it some protection against attacks. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates how many Armour Points the creature gains to all locations. This trait does not stack with armour. This armour stacks with worn armour, but not with the Machine Trait.",BC,Core
Natural Weapons,"This creature has sharp claws, teeth, spines or some other natural weapon with which it can slice and dice its foes. It counts as being armed even when not wielding weapons. Its attacks deal 1d10 points of Damage plus its Strength Bonus. The creature may make attacks with its Natural Weapons using its Weapon Skill, though it cannot parry with its natural weapons, nor can it be disarmed—unless, of course its limbs are hacked off ! (In general, creatures with Natural Weapons are immune to the Power Field quality, as it’s assumed they have enough teeth, claws, or spines to ignore a few being removed.) Natural weapons have the Primitive (7) Special Quality, unless stated otherwise in the profile.",BC,Core
Phase,"A creature with this trait can transform its body into an insubstantial state, passing ghost-like through solid objects or barriers of any sort. This trait functions exactly like the Incorporeal trait, except the creature may become solid or insubstantial by spending a Half Action. Phase carries additional limitations. A creature in a phased state cannot cross psychically charged barriers, holy wards, or energy fields designed to flux space or manipulate the warp, such as a Gellar Field or a Void Shield.",BC,Core
Psyker,"Whether due to unnatural influences, the study of forbidden lore, or simply sheer force of will, this individual is a Psyker, and can bend the Immaterium to his will. Though this Trait has no benefits on its own, it allows characters to purchase the Psyniscience Skill and the Psy Rating and Psychic Power Talents.",BC,Core
Possession,"Certain spirit-beings and denizens of the warp have the ability to possess mortal bodies. This is a far more insidious and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or even the power of the strongest psykers to “wear” the bodies of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is merged with the victim’s living body on a fundamental level so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below, although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may vary. Note that Daemonhosts, being extraordinary powerful examples of deliberate, ritualistic possessions, designed to bind and control daemons in living vessels, are a special case and dealt with separately. The Possession Attack The entity must be within a few metres of its intended victim and use a Full Action. The creature and target make Opposed Willpower Tests each round until either the entity or the victim achieve a total of five Degree of Success over the other—this is cumulative over several rounds. If the entity wins, it successfully possesses its victim. If their victim wins, he has repelled the entity who may not attempt to possess him again for 24 hours. A repelled entity also takes 1d10 points of Damage which is not reduced by armour or Toughness.",BC,Core
Quadruped,"Quadrupeds are much quicker over a distance than their bipedal counterparts. There movement is double that normally indicated by their Agility Bonus (see page 39). This trait is intended to cover creatures with hind legs and forepaws. Creatures with more than four legs may gain this Trait as well increasing their movement as indicated above but adding an addition 2 to their final movement rate (after doubling) for each set of legs beyond the first two (i.e. +2 for 6 legs, +4 for 8 legs etc).",BC,Core
Regeneration (X),"Creatures with this trait heal very quickly. Each round, at the start of its turn, the creature makes a Toughness Test to removes an amount of Damage indicated in the parenthesis after the trait. It loses this trait when slain.",BC,Core
Size (X),"Creatures come in one of ten different size categories, as shown on Table 4-8: Size. Size affects movement, how well the creature can hide and move undetected and how easy or hard it is to strike in combat. When calculating movement, apply the size modifier first, and then other modifiers from other Traits or Talents (such as Quadruped). For the purposes of comparison, a human is a Size (4) creature. Note, a creature’s movement cannot be reduced to less than 1.",BC,Core
Sonar Sense,"A creature with this trait perceives its surroundings by emitting a frequency noise, allowing the creature to locate the position of any solid object within 30 metres. Other creatures within this 30 metre range, and that succeed on an Awareness Skill Test at -10, may detect the curious keening.",BC,Core
Soul-Bound,"The soul of this creature is bound to a higher power or being, in return for a measure of protection. When this Trait is first gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially Astropaths, are soul-bound to the Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos Sorcerers may be bound to one of the Ruinous Powers. A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional die when forced to roll on the Perils of the Warp table, discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result. (Essentially, he may replace either the ones die or the tens die with the extra die he rolls) Upon becoming soul-bound, a character must choose one of the following effects: 1d10 Insanity Points (this does not apply to Heretics, as they do not suffer Insanity), the permanent loss of their sight, permanent loss of 1d10 from one Characteristic, or a random mutation. In addition, a soul-bound character is permanently indebted to the entity, which undoubtedly entails all manner of other duties and consequences.",BC,Core
Stampede,"Whenever a creature with this trait fails a Willpower Test, it automatically stampedes, charging in a straight line forwards as far as possible, overrunning anything in its path until the source of danger has escaped or is crushed under hoof, taking Damage equal to the creature’s Natural Weapon Damage (or 1d5+SB I if it does not have one). One stampeding creature automatically causes all other creatures within sight to stampede. The stampede lasts until the source of danger is no longer visible or for 1d10 minutes, whichever occurs last.",BC,Core
Strange Physiology,"A creature with this Trait has an unusual, alien, or altogether bizarre anatomy. All hits count as Body hits and death results when damage equals or exceeds the creature’s Wounds.",BC,Core
Sturdy,Sturdy creatures are hard to move and thus gain a +20 bonus to tests made to resist grappling and uses of the Takedown Talent.,BC,Core
Swarm,"Too small to do much on their own, swarms overwhelm their opponents via sheer weight of numbers. A swarm is often a mass of Miniscule or Puny creatures. Any attack from a weapon that does not either have the Blast, Flame, Spray, or Scatter Qualities only inflicts half Damage. In most circumstances, a swarm creature cannot be Grappled, Knocked Down, or Pinned, and the swarm may “pour” through suitable small openings such as ducts, vents, and the like, but they may not Jump. The swarm is counted as being destroyed once all its Wounds are lost. The swarm’s attacks have a variable Penetration value (roll each time an attack lands), representing its ability to engulf their victims and attack vulnerable areas.",BC,Core
The Stuff of Nightmares,"Some warp entities are so terribly powerful the will perpetuating their bodies in our reality is almost impossible to break or disrupt. Such entities are completely immune to the effects of poisons, diseases, the need to breathe, most environmental hazards, bleeding, stunning. They also ignore any critical result other than one that would destroy them outright, unless it was caused by a psychic power, force weapon, or holy attack.",BC,Core
Touched By The Fates (X),The creature or NPC has a number of Fate Points shown in parenthesis (X). It may use these Fate Points in exactly the same way as Player Characters and may even ‘burn’ a Fate Point to survive death and destruction at the GM’s discretion. The rules for Zealous Hatred also apply to this creature or NPC.,BC,Core
Toxic (X),A creature with this trait is poisonous Some weapons rely on toxins and poisons to do their damage. Anyone that successfully deals damage to a Toxic creature must make a Toughness Test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parenthesis (X) or suffer 1d10 points of Damage (of the same type as the weapon which inflicted the hit) not reduced by armour or Toughness. For example a creature with Toxic (4) would impose a –40 on Toughness Tests. Some creatures may carry additional effects with their toxins or inflict more Damage as indicated in their individual descriptions.,BC,Core
Undying,"This creature has a strange and ill understood physiology. It cannot be harmed by diseases, poisons, or toxic effects. It has no need to breathe and can survive unaided in a vacuum.",BC,Core
Unnatural Characteristic (X),"One or more of the creature’s Characteristics is unnatural. This is indicated by a number which is then added directly to the creature’s Characteristic Bonus. For example, a creature with a Strength of 41 normally has a 4 Strength Bonus. If the creature had Unnatural Characteristic Strength (3) then its Strength Bonus increases to 7 (4+3). A creature may have this Trait more than once. Each time, it is applied to a new Characteristic. In addition, whenever someone with an Unnatural Characteristic succeeds on a Test utilizing that Characteristic, they gain a number of bonus Degrees of Success equal to half of their Unnatural Characteristic.",BC,Core
Unnatural Senses (X),"The creature can perceive its surroundings using senses other than sight or hearing, using special organs, fine hairs, or some other disturbing trait to make itself aware of what’s around it. This trait always includes a range in metres indicated by the number in parenthesis (X).",BC,Core
Warp Instability,"Most warp-entities have a tenuous hold on our reality, often maintained only by horror and bloodshed, and may be disrupted if sufficient harm can be done to their manifested forms. If a creature with this trait takes Damage and does not deal Damage or Insanity Points on other creatures by the end of its next turn, it must make a Willpower Test. The creature takes 1d5 Damage for failure, plus 1 Damage for each Degree of Failure. This Damage cannot be prevented by any means including armour and Toughness. If this would deal Damage equal to or in excess of the creature’s Wounds, it is cast back into the warp.",BC,Core
Warp Weapons,"Creatures with this trait have weapons that are partially insubstantial, able to ignore such mundane things as armour or cover. Natural weapons and attacks made by a creature with this trait ignore physical armour unless it is created from psychoactive materials or is somehow warded against the warp. Force fields still work against these attacks normally",BC,Core
Inspiring Presence,"The Aspiring Champions are natural leaders, and often shape warbands in their own image whether deliberately or not. When an ally within sight of the Aspiring Champion uses an Infamy Point, as a Free Action the Aspiring Champion may choose to allow the ally to use his Infamy Point as if he possessed the Aspiring Champion’s Corruption Point level and Alignment.",BC,Core
Cold Killer,"Chosen are masters of conflict and combat, and few are better at crippling or killing their opponent. When a Chosen inflicts Zealous Hatred on a target, he may choose to reroll the Crit Result. The second result stands.",BC,Core
Resourceful,"Forsaken are well acquainted with the challenges of operating alone, chief among them the need for supplies. The Forsaken gains a +10 to his Infamy Test when obtaining an item or items with an Availability of Rare or lower.",BC,Core
Sorcerer,"The Heretic gains the Psyker Trait, a Psy Rating of 2, and 1 Corruption Point. When determining Psychic Strength, he counts as Bound.",BC,Core
Serpent's Tongue,"The Apostate is a master of infiltration, deception, and seduction, allowing him to ingratiate himself with organisations who would normally kill him on sight. Once per game session, the Apostate may make a Challenging Charm or Deceive Test to gain the Peer Talent with one organisation of his choice for the remainder of the session. If the Apostate has a Fellowship of 55 or higher, he can gain the Peer (2) Talent for a chosen organisation instead.",BC,Core
Traitor to Mars,"The Heretek was once a Tech-Priest of Mars (or has been equipped by those who were). He still possesses the tools of his former life. The Heretek gains the Mechanicus Implants Trait (listed above), as well as two Good Craftsmanship Cybernetics of his choice (also listed above). In addition, he gains the Binary Chatter ability. This ability increases the loyalty of all minions who are servitors or other cybernetic constructions by 10.",BC,Core
Adroit,"The Renegade is a skillful and talented individual who substitutes raw power for honed ability. The Renegade must select one Characteristic at Character Creation. Throughout the game, he adds one additional Degree of Success to successful Tests involving that Characteristic (this includes Skill and Characteristic Tests).",BC,Core
Chaos Psyker,"The Heretic is an unsanctioned psyker with access to the powers of the warp. He begins play with the Psyker Trait, a Psy Rating of 3, and 1d5 Corruption Points. In addition, when determining his Psychic Strength he counts as Unbound.",BC,Core
The Quick and The Dead,"To survive in the Vortex, particularly as a human, one must be quick, both in wits and action. Sometimes fast reflexes can compensate for ceramite armour. All Heretics with this Trait add a +2 bonus to Initiative Rolls.", BC, Core
