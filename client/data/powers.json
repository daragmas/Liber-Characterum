    "Description": "The Sorcerer\u2019s tainted soul draws to it the denizens of the warp, who clamour to his presence. At his command, they can press against the skin of reality, their shrieks and howls and the visions they inflict horrific to behold. Few beings have the mental fortitude to gaze upon a being surrounded by a cacophonous swarm of daemons, disrupting their ability to target him. While this power remains in effect, any creature attempting to target the Sorcerer with any form of attack must attempt a Willpower Test, with a \u20135 times the Sorcerer\u2019s Psy Rating penalty. If the attacker succeeds at this test, he may attack as normal. However, failure means that his revulsion prevents him attacking. He may choose another target to attack instead. Psychic Phenomena: The pressure of daemonic horde tearing at the fabric of existence thins the veil, making it risky for psykers to draw too deeply from the warp. While this power remains in effect, any psyker within 30m must add +20 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena table (including any generated by this power)."

Many sorcerers attribute this power to the genetic tampering of Fabius Bile during the early days of the Heresy, and to the engineered talents of Lord-Commander Eidolon of the Emperor\u2019s Children. A Hellshriek is a Psychic Blast centred on the Sorcerer. Any creature within the area of effect, with the exception of the Sorcerer, suffers 2d10 + Psy Rating Rending Damage with the Concussive (1) and Warp Weapon Qualities. Psychic Phenomena: The shrieking cry of the Sorcerer reverberates through the warp, echoing for moments after the initial blast of sound, lingering in the ears and minds of those nearby. Until the start of the Sorcerer\u2019s next turn, all creatures within range of the power suffer a \u201320 penalty to all Perception Tests. This is in addition to any normal psychic phenomena."

Amphibious, Amorphous, Burrower (2), Flyer (3), Deadly Natural Weapons, Multiple Arms (1), Natural Armour (2), Sonar Sense, Sturdy, Unnatural Senses (5).

    "Description": "The Sorcerer unleashes the raw power of the warp into reality, burning away the sham of the material universe. Few things can stand before the relentless tide of the Immaterium, and fewer emerge unscathed. Many sorcerers think of this power as being a refl ection of the true nature of the Chaos Gods, the purest manifestation of their desires. Primordial Annihilation must be used at the Push power level. This power is a Psychic Blast, centred on the Sorcerer himself, with a radius equal to the range of the power. All creatures within the radius, except for the Sorcerer himself, take a single hit dealing 1d10 Energy Damage times the Sorcerer\u2019s Psy Rating, with the Flame and Warp Weapon qualities. Psychic Phenomena: The warp boils forth in an unstoppable tide, doing far more than simply burn away everything in its path. Roll twice on Table 6\u20133: Perils of the Warp and apply both effects immediately, instead of any normal Psychic Phenomena."

The servants of the Inquisition frequently employ such methods to interrogate particularly resistant suspects, and it is for this reason that they are so feared by enemies of the Imperium, but they are far from the only group who employ psykers to steal secrets from the minds of their foes. It takes fi ve rounds of sustained effort to completely probe the mind of an individual. It requires a Focus Power Test, opposed by the target\u2019s Willpower Test, each round the power is sustained, with the same modifi ers as the initial test to use the power (though there is no chance of Psychic Phenomena for any round after the fi rst). If the psyker wins the Focus Power Test, he gleans information from the target\u2019s mind, depending on how long he has successfully maintained the power. If the psyker fails the Focus Power Test, he is ejected from the target\u2019s mind, unable to dig any deeper, and the power\u2019s effects end. However, the psyker retains any knowledge he has already gained from the power\u2019s use up until that point. A psyker can attempt to perform this power subtly, preventing the target from knowing that his mind has been infi ltrated. This changes the Focus Power Test to a Hard (\u201320) Opposed Willpower Test, and the power may only be used at the Fettered power level."

When using constant motion, the Focus Power Test is Routine (+20), and the psyker may move any object within range and line of sight that weighs no more than 10kg x Psy Rating. Objects moved in this way can only be moved too slowly to be used to attack, and when released the object drifts slowly to the ground. When using a rapid push, the Focus Power Test is Ordinary (+10), and Opposed by a Strength Test from a single target within range and line of sight. If the target fails the test, he is thrown backwards Psy Rating metres, plus an additional metre for every Degree of Success on the Focus Power Test. When using a forceful throw, the Focus Power Test is Challenging (+0), and allows the psyker to lift an object weighing no more than 5kg x Psy Rating and thrown at an enemy within range, hitting them to deal 1d10 Impact Damage +1 for every 5kg of the object\u2019s weight."

    "Description": "The psyker\u2019s gaze is cast upon the infinite tides of the warp, to seek out the future of a single, specific individual. While supposedly something of a staple of soothsayers and other petty seers, it takes real skill to gain more than the vaguest impressions. The Emperor\u2019s Tarot is a common method within the Imperium, while Eldar Farseers typically employ tiny, psychically conductive runes to divine the future, but untold billions of different methods exist within the myriad civilisations across the galaxy. To begin with, the power\u2019s target must specify a circumstance that he wishes to have divined. This may be as detailed as \u201cWhat forces defend the Mechanicus Basilica on Belacane?\u201d or as vague as \u201cHow can I attain glory and power in the name of the Dark Gods?\u201d The more precise the question, the more specifi c the reading may be. Once the question is established, the psyker and the target spend the next thirty minutes using assorted psychic foci\u2014drawing Tarot cards, sifting through the entrails of exotic beasts, casting runes, gazing deep into fi re or toxin-saturated water, or any of countless other methods. At the end of this time, the psyker makes his Focus Power Test to discern the weave of the target\u2019s future. Each Degree of Success reveals more information, as explained on Table 6\u20135: Personal Augury Results."

Unscrupulous psykers have frequently used this technique to perform all manner of illicit tasks, their uncanny proficiency in a vast range of tasks due as much to prophetic talent as to any mundane skill. The psyker gains a bonus equal to fi ve times his Psy Rating on the first non-Evasion Skill Test he performs before the end of his next turn."

However, the psyker has learned to do just that, seeing the way his foes fight and discerning moments of weakness, discerning opportunities to strike. Eldar Warlocks often turn this technique to their advantage, striking with uncanny accuracy. The psyker gains a bonus on the first Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test during this turn, equal to +5 x his Psy Rating."
