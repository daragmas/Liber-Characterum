Air Of Authority,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Fellowship': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character was born to command, either motivating or terrifying those under their charge. When making Command Skill Tests, the character may affect a number of targets equal to 10 times his Fellowship bonus. If the character has Minions (see page 135) they are also more devoted to him and add +10 to their Loyalty when in his presence. This talent has no effect on hostile targets, and only affects NPCs.",
Ambidextrous,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Agility': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","This talent does not represent true ambidexterity so much as sufficient training with both hands to make the distinction mute. The character may use either hand equally well for any task, and does not suffer the –20 penalty for actions using his off hand. Special: When combined with the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent, the penalty for making attacks with both weapons in the same Turn drops to –10.",
Ancient Warrior,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Fellowship': 35}, {'Willpower': 35}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character is either a veteran of the Long War or has served with those that have fought in its many wars down the centuries. Though the character does not need to be a Chaos Space Marine to take this talent it is rare for those outside their ranks to possess it. This Talent must be taken at Character Creation. The character can command special respect from other veterans of the Long War and gains a +10 to all Fellowship Tests and Skill Tests based on Fellowship when dealing with such NPCs. In addition, Chaos Space Marine Minions of the character increase their loyalty by +10. Long War weaponry is also easier for him to obtain and all weapons with the word “Legion” in the title count as one Availability category easier than normal (i.e. Rare becomes Scarce, Scarce becomes Average, etc.). Finally, veterans of the Long War are despised by the Imperium and the Adeptus Astartes especially, and should the character’s past become known by these powers it is likely to end in blood...",
Armour-Monger,2,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Intelligence': 35}], 'Skills': [{'Tech-Use': 0}, {'Trade (Armourer)': 0}], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}",The character is a skilled armourer and constantly tinkers and improves his armour or keeps it in pristine shape by repairing the slightest Damage it sustains. With years of training the character has even learned to enhance the protection afforded by his armour and learned how to use it in its optimum fashion. The character increases the Armour Points of any armour he wears by 2 on all locations it would normally cover as long as he has at least an hour each day to clean and repair it or make minor modifi cations. This bonus applies only to armour worn by the character as it combines his training as much as his skill at armoury.,
Arms Master,3,"{'Talents': ['Weapon Training (any two)'], 'Characteristics': [{'Weapon Skill': 40}, {'Ballistic Skill': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The Heretic is a true master of weapons and there is practically nothing he cannot pick up and use with ease, from boltguns to plasma pistol or powerblades to shock mauls. When the Heretic uses a weapon he is untrained in, he only suffers a –10 penalty, rather than a –20. The only exceptions to the Arms Master Talent are exotic weapons, which are so unusual or rare that they always require their own weapon training Talents to use without penalty and gain no bonus when combined with this talent.",
Assassin Strike,3,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Agility': 40}], 'Skills': [{'Acrobatics': 0}], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character’s natural agility and graceful martial forms turn him into a dervish of death on the battlefi eld. After making a melee attack, a successful Acrobatics Skill Test allows the character to move at half rate as a Free Action. The character’s opponent does not receive a free attack resulting from this move. The character may only make this move once per round.",
Baleful Dirge,2,"{'Talents': ['Disturbing Voice'], 'Characteristics': [], 'Skills': [{'Intimidate': 10}], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character can sing an unnatural droning dirge which makes the skin of those nearby crawl and their minds shy away from its discordant notes. Singing the dirge takes some concentration and requires a Half Action each round to maintain. All creatures which can hear the character within a 30-metre radius must make a Willpower Test or suffer a –10 on their next roll. As long as the dirge is maintained, all those affected by it must test each turn to see if they suffer its effects. Once a creature passes a Willpower Test however, it has completely overcome the dirge and is not affected by it for the remainder of the encounter.",
Bastion Of Iron Will,3,"{'Talents': ['Psy Rating', 'Strong Minded'], 'Characteristics': [{'Willpower': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character’s sheer willpower and psychic focus have become one and the same over years of practice and training, such that their combined use is second nature.

Battle Rage,2,"{'Talents': ['Frenzy'], 'Characteristics': [], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}",Long experience and indomitable will have allowed the character to master the beast within; directing its rage while keeping his head despite the howling bloodlust in his mind. The character may Parry while frenzied. In addition such is the character’s control he may reroll a failed roll to snap out of Frenzy or resist entering Frenzy if he so chooses.,
Berserk Charge,1,['None'],"The character has learned to put the whole force of his momentum behind his weapon blows and when the character charges into combat, few can stand before him. If the character uses the Charge Action, he gains a +30 bonus to Weapon Skill instead of +20.",
Betrayer,2,"{'Talents': ['Cold Hearted'], 'Characteristics': [], 'Skills': [{'Intimidate': 0}], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character has little regard for the lives of others should it advance his goals. Once per game session the character may kill either an allied NPC (i.e. an NPC which is openly friendly toward the PC and trusts him) or one of his own Minions. Such calculated cruelty boosts the Heretic’s reputation, granting him a +10 bonus on his next Infamy Test if the victim was an NPC and +20 if it was a Minion (and harder to replace). Killing NPCs and Minions usually has consequences as well which should be determined by the GM.",
Blademaster,3,"{'Talents': ['Weapon Training (any melee)'], 'Characteristics': [{'Weapon Skill': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character’s mastery of bladed weapons and his martial disciplines has no peer.

Blade Dancer,3,"{'Talents': ['Two-Weapon Wielder (Melee)'], 'Characteristics': [{'Weapon Skill': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character has mastered the diffi cult ability to wield a blade or other melee weapon in either hand making expert simultaneous attacks as he weaves a deadly pattern of steel. When armed with two singled handed melee weapons with the Balanced Quality, the character reduces the penalties for Two-Weapon Fighting (see page 243) by 10 (so –20 would drop to –10). If taken with the Ambidextrous Talent, this drops the penalty to +0.",
Blasphemous Incantation,3,"{'Talents': ['Psy Rating'], 'Characteristics': [], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","As a realm of coherent thought and tangible emotion, the warp is infl uenced by the minds of mortals. Using complex formulae and ritualistic incantations to focus and direct thoughts, a mortal mind can exert infl uence over the Immaterium more easily. However, the tiniest slip in focus and concentration, the slightest mispronunciation in the incantation, can result in the warp being unleashed in a dangerous and destructive manner. Using a power with an incantation increases the Focus Power Test by a Half Action, as the psyker requires a few moments to speak the required words. Powers for which the Focus Power Test takes a Reaction cannot be used with an invocation. Using a power with an invocation grants the psyker a +1 bonus to his Psy Rating, after determining Psychic Strength. This bonus to PR does not infl uence the Psychic Strength in any way; their benefi t is applied after determining whether a power is used at the Unfettered, Fettered or Push level. However, the psyker must add +20 to any roll on the Psychic Phenomena table. Finally, any result of 91 or higher on the Focus Power Test is an automatic failure that results in Perils of the Warp.",
Blind Fighting,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Perception': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","Years of practice and development of other senses allows the character to fi ght in close combat without the benefi t of sight. This talent reduces all penalties for fi ghting with a melee weapon while suffering from obscured vision by half (rounded up), permitting the character to fi ght in fog, smoke or darkness more effectively. See page 245 for a full list of attack penalties based on lighting and vision. Note this talent only improves a character’s chances to hit with melee weapons and has not effect on ranged weapon attacks.",
Blood God’S Contempt,3,"{'Talents': ['Frenzy'], 'Characteristics': [{'Willpower': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character spends the time before battle armouring himself against the power of the warp by cursing the names of sorcerers and showing his fearlessness before his feeble power and all those who wield the power of the warp. This talent may be used at any time by a character as long as he has at least an hour to perform his ritual of contempt (a player may say his character has already p e r f o rmed the ritual before play begins if the GM agrees). The character must also spend one Infamy Point. During the game session whenever the character is the subject of the effects of a psychic power, daemonic power or other warp based power, he may make a Willpower Test (make this test before any tests he would normally be permitted to resist the effects of the power). If the Willpower test is passed the character is unaffected by the psychic power. If the test is failed then the psychic power affects him as normal and he becomes Frenzied in addition to any other effects (see page 124). The effects of this talent only apply to powers that directly affect the character (such as targeted powers or powers which catch him in their area of effect) and not powers which may harm him indirectly (such as attack from summoned daemons or falling or fl ung debris from a telekinetic). In addition, powers used by friendly psykers must also be resisted (and also cause Frenzy should he fail to resist them). A power that is resisted by a character using this talent is not nullifi ed and others are affected by it as normal.",
Bolter Drill,3,"{'Talents': ['Weapon Training (Bolter)'], 'Characteristics': [{'Ballistic Skill': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character is a master of the boltgun, either because of his training in the Space Marine Legions or because of long years of practise and copious amounts of ammo. The character can use bolters of all types to unleash devastating volleys of disciplined fi re that can cut down his enemies like the sweep of a scythe. When firing any class of Bolt weapon on full or semi-auto the character may score one additional Degree of Success (provided the Test is successful) if he does not take a Move Action in his turn.",
Bulging Biceps,2,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Strength': 45}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","Whereas a weaker man would be sent flying when using heavy weapons, the character’s strong physique allows him to remain standing. The character can fi re heavy weapons using Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst without bracing, and he does not suffer the -30 penalty for failing to brace. In addition whenever the character uses the Athletics Heft Special Skill Use (see page 96) he may add +20 to his Athletics Skill Test to refl ect his massive muscles.",
Catfall,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Agility': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","Gymnastic ability and natural balance enables the character to fall great distances without harm. The character automatically reduces the distance of all falls by a number of metres equal to his Agility Bonus, ignoring this distance as if it did not exist. In addition the character adds +20 to his Acrobatics Skill Tests when using the Jump Special Skill Use as it pertains to reducing Damage from falling.",
Cold Hearted,1,['None'],"The character is almost devoid of sentiment or physical lusts and is seldom swayed by the emotions of others, almost to an unnatural degree. Seduction attempts against him automatically fail, and he gains a +20 to his Willpower when making Opposed Tests against an opponent using the Charm Skill. Taking this Talent gives the character one Corruption Point.",
Child Of The Warp,2,"{'Talents': ['Psy Rating'], 'Characteristics': [], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","As a result of prolonged exposure to the warp and excessive use of psychic powers the character has become saturated with warp energy. This grants greater connection to the warp and increases the character’s Psy Rating by +1 when he chooses to Push (see Chapter VI: Powers of the Warp). The downside, however, is that the warp is always partially manifest in his presence and he generates constant psychic phenomena. At the start of each game session the character should roll 1d10 on Table 4-4: Child of the Warp to determine the nature of these persistent effects which follow him for the duration of the session. Alternatively, with the GM’s consent the player may select one phenomena from the following list that always effects him, eliminating the need to roll each session. Note that the character still suffers from Psychic Phenomena and Perils of the Warp as normal.",
Combat Formation,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Intelligence': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character has directed his comrades to be prepared for danger, planning out his actions for m a n y contingencies if attacked. Before rolling initiative, all members of the group (including the character) add +1 to his Initiative Rolls.

Combat Master,2,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Weapon Skill': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character’s weapon seems to be everywhere at once, keeping many more opponents at bay in close combat than would seem possible.

Combat Sense,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Perception': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character has the ability to consciously recognise the prodding of his subconscious as it reacts to his preternaturally sharp senses, giving the character an edge that mere speed cannot match. The character may use his Perception Bonus in place of his Agility Bonus when rolling Initiative.",
Counter Attack,2,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Weapon Skill': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character’s lightning ripostes are things of deadly beauty; swift and invisible as the wind. After successfully parrying an opponent’s attack, the character may immediately make an attack against that opponent using the weapon with which he parried as a Free Action even though it is not his turn. This attack suffers a –20 penalty and may not be combined with any ability which allows more than one hit or attack such as Lighting Attack or Two-Weapon Fighting.",
Corpus Conversion,2,"{'Talents': ['Psy Rating'], 'Characteristics': [], 'Skills': [], 'Race': 'Human', 'Special': []}","To the truly dedicated Sorcerer, the fl esh is a fl eeting inconvenience, a transitory shell to contain his glory until he ascends to something greater. Such beings, whether truly blessed by the Dark Gods, or merely insane, are willing to burn his fl esh in exchange for power, gathering the corrosive power of the Warp and holding it within muscle, bone, sinew and hair until the time comes to unleash it. A psyker with the Corpus Conversion Talent gains access to this Path to Power, and may elect to use it before he attempts his Focus Power Test. The psyker may gain a number of bonus Degrees of Success no greater than his Toughness Bonus on his Focus Power Test. However, for every Degree of Success gained in this way, the psyker suffers 1d10 Toughness Damage (note, this is not permanent Toughness Damage) and one Corruption Point as the energies of the warp poison his body from within. Traitor Legion characters may not benefi t from Corpus Conversion; the taint-resistant metabolism of the Astartes makes them incapable of burning away his fl esh to fuel warp-based powers.",
Crack Shot,2,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Ballistic Skill': 50}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character can place his shots where it infl icts more harm such as at creases, gaps or joints in armour.

Cursed Heirloom,1,['None'],"Passed down through the ages, the character has come into possession of an ancient ancestral heirloom. The character may choose any weapon (melee or ranged) or armour from Chapter V: Armoury with an Availability of Very Rare or less without the need to make an Acquisition Test. He must, however, roll 1d5 once for the item on Table 4-5: Cursed Heirloom giving it a permanent curse. He is now bonded to the item and even if it is lost, destroyed, or stolen it always somehow turns up in its original condition at the start of the next game session. Such items also usually come with a history of their own and the GM should feel free to have the item’s past come back to haunt the character from time to time.",
Deadeye Shot,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Ballistic Skill': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character’s rock-steady hand and hawk-like eyesight make him a dreaded marksman.

Once the character has tested to knock down those in his way, he may complete his Charge and make his attacks against his intended target.",
Total Recall,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Intelligence': 30}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","Mental conditioning or mental augmentation enables the character to record and recall great amounts of information, effectively granting him a perfect memory. The character can automatically remember trivial facts or pieces of information the character might feasibly have picked up in the past. When dealing with more detailed, complex or obscure facts, such as the exact layout of a defence network, the GM may require a successful Intelligence Test to recall the information.",
True Grit,3,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Toughness': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}",The character is able to shrug off wounds that would fell lesser men. Whenever the character suffers Critical Damage (after reduction for Armour and Toughness) reduce the amount by his Toughness Bonus (to a minimum of 1).,
Two-Weapon Wielder,2,['None'],"Intensive training allows the character to use a weapon in each hand when needed. When armed with two one-handed weapons (either melee or ranged weapons), after making a Half Action Attack (this can be a Single Attack, a Swift Attack, or a Lightning Attack with a melee weapon, or a single shot, semi-auto burst, or full-auto burst with a ranged weapon), he may make a Half Action Attack following the same restrictions with the other weapon. (in effect, this allows the character to attack twice in a round; once from each of his weapons). Both tests made to attack with the weapons suffer a –20 penalty. This Talent may be taken twice, each time with a different focus (melee or ranged). If a character possesses both Talents, then he may fi ght with one melee and one ranged weapon. This talent may be enhanced by the Ambidextrous, Blade Dancer, Gunslinger and Sidearm talents.","['Melee', 'Ranged']"
Unarmed Master,2,"{'Talents': ['Unarmed Warrior'], 'Characteristics': [{'Weapon Skill': 45}, {'Agility': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}",The Heretic possesses unparalleled mastery of unarmed combat. He counts as having the Deadly Natural Weapon Trait.,
Unarmed Warrior,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Weapon Skill': 35}, {'Agility': 35}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}",Due to extensive training in techniques of unarmed combat the character has gained the Natural Weapon Trait (see page 142) improving all his unarmed attacks from 1d5-3 to 1d10 Primitive (7) and meaning he counts as armed even when facing opponents with weapons while bare handed.,
Unholy Devotion,3,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': ['Minion of Chaos']}","The character’s Minions are fanatically devoted to him and would gladly die in his name. Whenever the character would be hit by a ranged attack he can make an Agility Test for any of his Minions which are no further away from him than his Agility Bonus in metres. If he passes the test then they suffer the hit instead as they have thrown themselves in front of their master, and all the hits effects are worked out against the Minion. Provided they are close enough any number of Minions may try to protect the character in this way—forming a human shield against harm. This Talent only works with Minions and not allied NPCs no matter how favourably they view the character!",
Unremarkable,1,['None'],"Something about the character’s face just doesn’t stick in people’s memories. The character can more easily blend into crowds or pass himself off as a nobody. Any attempts to recall the character’s face or spot him in a crowd suffer a –20 penalty. In addition the character gains a +20 when using the Deceive Skill to either convince someone he has never seen or met him before or if he is trying to appear harmless and ordinary. Naturally this Talent doesn’t work if the character wears distinctive clothes or armour, or carries unique weaponry—a Chaos Space Marine hiding in a crowd of Imperial citizens is pretty easy to spot, especially since they are probably running screaming in all directions...",
Unshakeable Will,2,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Willpower': 35}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}",The character’s faith in the gods and in himself are so strong that he can face any danger with a sneer and a ready insult.

War Cry,3,"{'Talents': ['Disturbing Voice'], 'Characteristics': [{'Strength': 50}, {'Willpower': 50}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","There is something supernatural about the character’s bellowing voice, its tones fi lled with the wails of daemons and its words repellent to the mind, causing terror in the weak. The character may declare at the start of any of his turns that he is making a war cry as a Free Action. All creatures within a 50-metre radius treat the character as if he had a Fear Rating of 1 provided they can hear him (though they do not need to be able to s e e h i m) until the start of his next turn. While screaming his bloodcurdling war cry, the character may not communicate in any other way. Making a war cry is taxing however and at the end of any encounter in which it is used (even if only for a single turn) the character suffers a level of Fatigue.",
Warp Conduit,2,"{'Talents': ['Psy Rating', 'Strong Minded'], 'Characteristics': [{'Willpower': 50}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The sheer power of the character’s mind allows the character to channel vast amounts of Warp Energy when he chooses to exert himself. When Pushing (see page 207), the character may spend one Infamy Point to add 1d5 to his Psy Rating. Channelling such vast amounts of power is dangerous, however, and he must add +30 to any resultant Psychic Phenomenon rolls.",
Warp Lock,3,"{'Talents': ['Psy Rating', 'Strong Minded'], 'Characteristics': [{'Willpower': 50}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character has learned to swiftly cut himself off from the warp to protect himself from harm and cocoon his mind against the worst of its effects. Once per game session the character may ignore a Psychic Phenomenon result he has rolled (including a result which would indicate rolling on the Perils of the Warp Table) completely negating its effects. Such rapid dislocation from the warp is stressful and traumatic to the character’s mind, however, and he suffers 1d5 Damage (not reduced by armour or Toughness) as a result, and may not make any Focus Power Tests or sustain other Psychic Powers until the beginning of his next Turn.",
Warp Sense,1,"{'Talents': ['Psy Rating'], 'Characteristics': [{'Perception': 30}], 'Skills': [{'Psyniscience': 0}], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character’s senses have evolved to perceive the Warp in parallel with the physical world. After gaining this talent, using the Psyniscience Skill requires a Free Action instead of a Half Action. In addition, the character can passively detect psychic effects and entities without the need to actively seek them out. Whenever the character could detect such warp signature or creature the GM may allow him to make a Psyniscience Skill Test to detect it, in the same way he might use Awareness to spot an ambush without knowing it is there.",
Weapon-Tech,1,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Intelligence': 40}], 'Skills': [{'Tech U s e': 10}], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character has developed an extensive understanding of advanced technological weapons and their functions, opening them up and learning what makes them tick, hum or click.

The character can use all weapons with Class: Pistol, Basic, Heavy, Throwing, and Melee within the group he has selected with this talent.

Wisdom Of The Ancients,2,"{'Talents': [], 'Characteristics': [{'Intelligence': 40}], 'Skills': [], 'Race': '', 'Special': []}","The character has survived many wars, seen much and been favoured with the experience of countless ancient warriors during his life. Within his mind and soul he holds the well of knowledge and wisdom that stretches back to the early years of the Long War. The character may spend an Infamy Point to get insight on a situation and ask the GM a question (which he should answer as helpfully as possible) about the immediate situation which his character faces. The question can be anything the character might legitimately know from stories he has heard or his own experience. For example, when raiding an Imperial cruiser the question might be “where are the Navigator’s quarters.”",
