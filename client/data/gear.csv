Unholy Unguents,BC,Core,0,Rare,Something that's unholy and an unguent
Combi-Tool,BC,Core,1,Rare,"Most combi-tools are small compact devices, filled with foldout and extending probes, blades, hooks, and socket-plugs ideal for coaxing operation from recalcitrant machinery, repairing damaged devices, and in general bending errant machine spirits to the will of the user. Using a combi-tool grants a +10 bonus to Tech-Use Tests."
Dataslate,BC,Core,0.5,Common,"Flat and rectangular, data-slates are widespread throughout Imperial space and are used to store text and other media. Cheap versions can only hold a single file and cannot be altered, while superior slates can be reconfi gured with different information from manual input or machine transmission and even transmit the data to other devices. Since they are seen throughout the Imperium, most authorities would never think to closely examine what information was actually on a slate carried by a “loyal” citizen in their daily business."
Medikit,BC,Core,2,Common,"Small, compact, and reliable, medi-kits are an essential part of anyone operating outside of Imperial society or away from easy access to medicae support. Each has a diagnostic cogitator complete with bio-scanner and probes, along with chemicals, drugs, and other means to treat a variety of injuries and ailments and will grant a +20 to those using it in conjunction with the Medicae Skill. Advanced models include such items as tox wands, synth-skin applicators, and other aids usually available only to the wealthiest of the Imperial elite. These gain the +20 bonus even if not possessing the Medicae Skill, but weight +3 kg and are Rare instead of Common."
Psy-focus,BC,Core,0,Average,"Also known as warp-totems or mind-eyes, a psy-focus allows those blessed with Warp powers to more easily channel their powers. It could be an ancestral bone, irradiated crystal, the twisted metal shrapnel fragment removed from a murdered spouse, or even an otherwise unremarkable object normally found anywhere. But in the hands of a psyker ready to use his powers against an Imperium that would sentence him to death or worse, the item is a mighty accessory. When a psyker with a psy-focus makes a Focus Power Test (see Chapter VI: Psychic Powers, page 208) he gains a +10 bonus."
Ballistic Mechadendrite,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"A common upgrade for many combat-oriented Hereteks, this two-metre mechanical limb emerges from the shoulder or back and is covered with writhing power conduits. It may be armed with any Pistol-class weapon with the Compact Upgrade. The Heretic may attack with this weapon as his Reaction. A Heretic must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use Talent to operate this implant."
Bionic Arm,BC,Core,0,Scarce,"One of the more common replacement limbs to be found, Common Craftsmanship versions ape a normal hand and arm exactly, retaining strength, dexterity and sense of touch. Poor Craftsmanship versions are more cumbersome and visibly artificial; halve the owner’s Agility score where matters of fine dexterity are involved. In addition, Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests made when using the limb take a –5 penalty. Good bionic arms improve on natural design and provide a +10 bonus on Agility Tests requiring delicate manipulation. Best Craftsmanship arms add a +10 bonus to Strength Tests using the arm and can be used to store small items such as pistol ammo clips inside concealed interior compartments."
Bionic Legs,BC,Core,0,Scarce,"In the basic common version, locomotion bionics are fully integrated into the hip with spinal link and allow a Heretic to walk, run, and climb at human norm levels. Poor Craftsmanship models, however, are lumbering affairs that reduce a Heretic’s movement rate by one (rounding up), and when running the user must succeed on an Agility Test or fall at the end of his movement. Good Craftsmanship level artifi cial legs grant the owner the Sprint Talent and add a +20 bonus to Athletics Tests made to jump or leap."
Bionic Respiratory System,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Bionic respiratory systems are often a must due to damage caused by the often exceedingly toxic atmospheres to be found in many settings. Common Craftsmanship bionic lungs and implanted respiratory systems allow the user to breathe as normal and gain a +20 bonus to Toughness Tests made to resist airborne toxins and gas weapons. Poor bionic lungs offer the same benefi ts as the Common system, but require louder mechanical fi ltration systems and users suffer a –20 penalty to all Silent Move checks. They are also overall less effective in blood oxygenatation and all tests involving strenuous physical activity are increased by one level of difficulty. Good bionic lungs count as a full life support system, so if for any reason the user’s own respiratory system fails, his bionic lungs will keep his blood oxygenated. These systems are generally unnoticeable when designed to be so."
Black Blood (Autosanguine),BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"A combination of microtech from the Dark Ages and obscene xenos biotech fl ows though veins now forever tainted. The minions of the Omnissiah refer to this as Autosanguine, but those who call themselves the Dark Mechanicus know it as Black Blood. Too small to see but powerful in their vast numbers, these machines can repair minor injuries and speed healing. When applying healing the Heretic is always considered Lightly Wounded; he also heals much faster than mere mortals and removes two points of Damage per day."
Blade-tines,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Long, thin blades sprout from one of the Heretic’s hands, razor sharp and useful as scalpels or cutting weapons. The hand must be completely rebuilt to accommodate this, and most versions feature long, spindly fi ngers that can extend past the blades to allow for dextrous tasks. The full appearance is decidedly unpleasant and even downright sinister. The blade-tines grant the Heretic +5 to Medicae Tests, +5 to Interrogation Tests, and can be used as a melee weapon in close combat, dealing 1d5+2 (plus Strength Bonus) Damage with a Penetration of 2. Good Craftsmanship versions can vibrate the blades at high frequencies, increasing the cutting power. The weapons gain the Tearing Trait. Best Craftsmanship versions also include drug producing bio-mechanical glands, with thin tubules to carry the venomous liquids to small openings underneath the blades. This grants the weapons the Toxic (0) Quality. Poor Craftsmanship versions only deal 1d5 plus Strength Bonus Damage without any Penetration."
Cerebral Implants,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"Commonly used to repair a severely damaged brain or hopefully augment its abilities, these often risky implant systems represent a major step from simply replacing a limb to altering a Heretic from human to mechanism. Common-level implants can restore paralysed and brain damaged users to a semblance of normality, but with a permanent loss of 1d10 points from the character’s Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Agility, Intelligence and Fellowship. Poor versions restore brain function but destroy the personality and memories of the subject, rendering them no better than a servitor, and as such are unsuitable for player characters (though a Heretic may encounter many an unfortunate fellow Chaos worshipper who has suffered such a fate). Good cerebral implants are very rare even among the elite and powerful, and are exceedingly difficult to arrange, becoming Near Unique in availability. These bestow Unnatural Intelligence (+2) (see page 144) and grants +20 bonuses to Logic and Lore Tests for the superior mental capabilities they now enjoy."
Chem Injector,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Many Heretics who rely on pharmacological boosts in combat have taken this implant, allowing them to inject themselves as needed with the chemicals they crave. One dose of a single drug may be loaded into the injector via a skin-mounted port (if this implant is taken multiple times, then multiple drugs may be loaded). The user may activate the injector as a Half Action requiring a Routine (+20) Willpower Test. A Failure means that injector has malfunctioned, and will require a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test to repair."
Cranial Armour,BC,Core,0,Scarce,"Microstrips of plasteel are bonded directly to the skull in subdermal layers, allowing for extra protection against head injury. Common Craftsmanship armour grants the user one extra Armour Point in the head location. Poor versions do the same, but permanently reduce the wearer’s Intelligence Characteristic by one due to the screws driven into the skull. Good Craftsmanship armour grants +1 AP and also subtract one from any Critical Effects to the head"
Cybernetic Senses,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Most human senses can be artificially duplicated, allowing radiation ruined eyes or eardrums ruptured by concussion blasts to be replaced. Some Heretics even attempt to improve on their natural abilities or create new ones via these artificial implants, to further delve into new realms of sensation. Common systems are usually obviously artificial and often oversized (especially optical implants) but duplicate the approximate human range of senses adequately with no further game effects. Poor cybernetic senses are inferior to base humanity’s level, often with static in the hearing, failures in colour vision, or taste buds that make everything taste like cloth. Users must take a –20 penalty to tests made involving the cybernetic sense. Good Craftsmanship implants grant the Heightened Senses Talent for that particular sense, and a +20 bonus to tests made to resist attacks on the sense itself (such as deafening noises or blinding flashes). Basic and advanced cyber-eyes may also incorporate telescopic sights (counting as a telescopic sight, see page 170 for more details), a full photo-visor, and/or a system allowing the Dark Sight trait (see page 140). Likewise basic or advanced cybernetic hearing may also include an internal micro-bead system. Each of these “extra” upgrades counts as a separate implant for the purposes of acquisition."
Embedded Auspex,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Expanding the realms of the senses is a common desire and this implant allows a Heretic a glimpse at what rewards true devotion might bring. Concentrating (a Half Action) allows the user to duplicate the effects of special sensory system. Common implants function as a standard Auspex (see page 184). Poor models offer only a single detection ability (either heat, harmful radiation, or electromagnetic fields) with only a 20m range. Good systems act as a full Auspex but also allow a re-roll on Perception based tests when it is in use."
Flesh Replenishment,BC,Core,0,Extremely Rare,"This implant system allows a Heretic to reinvigorate themselves by drawing on the energies of external machines. When in contact with a functioning machine, fully-charged battery, or other power source, the subdermal induction ports can allow the user to siphon off energy into their own body by making a Toughness Test with a +10 bonus. Success removes one level of Fatigue plus one additional level for each additional Degree of Success as the power energises neural and muscle tissue, or alternatively can recharge their Internal Reservoir if they have that implant as well."
Ferric Lure Implants,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"Powerful electromagnets are implanted in the Heretic, allowing him to cast forth a net of invisible energy as a Full Action requiring a successful Challenging (+0) Willpower Test and call an unsecured metal object into his hand. The object cannot mass more than 1kg per point of Willpower Bonus and must be within 20 metres, and the user must already have Mechanicus Implants for this system to function. This implant can be improved by certain Talents (page 124)."
Luminen Capacitor,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"The Heretic’s internal energies, either through biological or artificial sources, are channelled into capacitors buried into the flesh where they can be tapped to recharge items or even released in devastating attacks. With a successful Toughness Test, the character may recharge or power machinery. This requires one minute of mental focus and meditation. The difficulty of the Toughness Test varies depending on the nature of the powered system: Ordinary (+10): Simple Power Cell, Illuminator; Challenging (+0): Weapon Charge Pack, Data-Slate, Bridge Terminal; Difficult (–10): Shuttle electronics, Servo-Skull; Hard (–20): Lascannon Charge Pack, Servitor, Bridge Hololith; Very Hard (–30): Cogitator Core, Reactor Machine Spirit, Xenos Technology. The device call also be used offensively, however it requires Talents to use properly (see page 127). Only a Heretic with Mechanicus Implants may use this device. Poor Craftsmanship variants impose a –10 penalty to all Toughness Tests made to use them (in effect, the Toughness Tests become one Degree more difficult). Good Craftsmanship variants grant a +10 bonus to all Toughness Tests made to use them (in effect, making the Tests one Degree easier)."
Interface Port,BC,Core,0,Rare,"The Heretic now has a mechanical port implanted in his body, commonly in the rear of the neck, which can be connected to machines via his own data ports. This allows the user faster and smoother access to the valuable information within, and grants a +10 bonus to Common Lore, Inquiry, or Tech-Use Tests whilst connected to a relevant mechanism or data spool."
Internal Reservoir,BC,Core,0,Rare,"This implant acts as a powerful battery, storing energy for various implants and especially for functions that require energy to be expelled in rapid or violent fashions. When fully charged, the user will no longer gain fatigue from using Luminen Capacitors either to recharge something or offensively, but each use of those implants drains the reservoir by 50%. The battery will be full recharged after one day of resting."
Servo-Arm,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Utilised by the renegade Mechanicus Hereteks, these massive manipulators contain powerful crushing pincers designed for field repairs but also useful in combat as well. Each is integrated into the user’s armour to offset the heavy weight and power requirements. A Servo-Arm can extend up to 1.5m from its shoulder or back mounting and has a fixed Strength value of 75 with Unnatural Strength (+7) – the user always uses this, no matter his own Strength or any other factors. The powerful mandibles allow him to lift heavy objects or tether himself to a suitable anchor as a Free Action. Against Imperial foes, a servo-arm is as mighty in battle as it is useful in repairs. The Heretic may strike with it as his Reaction for the round or use it to make a Standard Attack (so long as it is only used once per round). It hits using his Weapon Skill, dealing 2d10+14 Impact Damage with Pen 10. Exceptional Craftsmanship from Heretek artisans (Best Craftsmanship versions) can improve the model, increasing the Strength to 85 (increasing Damage to 2d10+15) and granting +10 to any Grapple Tests. A Heretic must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use Talent to operate this implant."
Maglev Coils,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"Archeotech systems of powerful gravimetric coils are implanted in the body, allowing the user to become unshackled from gravity’s grasp for short periods. Using a Half Action, the user may hover 20-30 centimetres off the ground for a number of minutes equal to 1d10 plus the character’s Toughness Bonus. The character must employ a Half Action each round to concentrate operating this implant and may use the other action to move normally. The character can slow their rate of descent when falling so long as this implant is active when the character reaches the ground, reducing all falling Damage to 1d10+3 Impact. Each time the character activates the coils, it drains the stored power and cannot be used again until recharged (taking one day)."
Manipulator Mechadendrite,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"Possibly the most common form of mechadendrite, this artificial limb is a great aid to those working in industrial or technical areas and allows a Heretic to lift greater weights and more easily operate industrial gear. It can extend out to 1.5m and grants the user +20 to Strength Tests; the viscous gripping and crushing pincers can also tether the user to gantries or suitably heavy objects as a Free Action. The heavy metal pincers may be used in combat to make melee attacks. The Heretic may strike with it as his Reaction for the round or use it to make a Standard Attack (so long as it is only used once per round). The Manipulator Mechadendrite deals 1d10+2 I Damage. While powerful, the manipulator is not subtle and attempts to use it for such tasks as data-slate typing, inscribing sacrificial etchings, handling delicate objects, or the like will only end with ruined equipment or failed summoning. A Heretic must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use Talent to operate this implant."
Mechanicus Assimilation,BC,Core,0,Extremely Rare,"This process is used either by the truly fanatical or the devastatingly injured, the user’s body is rebuilt with interlaced bionic replacements, augmenting and supporting the biological systems. Now almost as much metal as flesh, the Heretic gains the Machine Trait (see page 141) with Armour points equal to the number of times this replacement upgrade is acquired. When taken multiple times, note the number, as in “Mechanicus Assimilation 3” when taken three times. There are no Poor Craftsmanship versions of cybernetic, and Good and Best Craftsmanship versions simply make the upgrade less noticeable. Hereteks count this upgrade as Rare, as opposed to Extremely Rare."
Medicae/Torture Mechadendrite,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"Made of thin, dextrous, two-metre tubes of metal and plasteel tipped with a variety of fascinating needles and blades, this mechadendrite can either heal or harm depending on a Heretic’s intent. In most cases it can provide medical and surgical assistance, granting a +10 bonus to Medicae Tests. It houses six injector pistons; each may be fi lled with one dose of a drug and must be supplied and replaced separately (these can also be used to inject the user). Built-in flesh staplers may be used to staunch blood loss as a Half Action while the chainscalpel attachment reduces the diffi culty of limb amputation to Challenging (+0) and deals 1d5 Rending Damage in combat, acting as an Improvised weapon. For those more interested in answers than mending, the blades and needles grant the user +10 bonus to Interrogation Tests. This mechadendrite may be shoulder or sternum mounted and the Heretic must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use Talent for operation."
Mind Impulse Unit (MIU),BC,Core,0,Rare,"Also known as sense-links, these arcane implants allow direct interface with a machine or technological device. A basic MIU rig involves a single spinal or cortex connector, while the advanced variant will also include wrist connector probes (and possibly mechadendrite connectors) in addition to the flesh plug. Common models add a +10 bonus to Tech-Use, Pilot or Drive Tests used in conjunction with devices capable of MIU linking. Poor systems are not properly tuned to the user’s brainwaves and require a successful Willpower Test to use. They impose a –10 penalty when attempting to interface with the device. Good models, however, are perfectly tuned and the user feels the interfaced devices as if they were parts of their own body, even to specially modifi ed weapons. They grant a +10 bonus to Tech-Use, Pilot, Drive, Logic, Inquiry and Weapon Skill Tests when interfaced with MIU systems."
Nerve Induction Tines,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Thin flexible metal spikes are implanted underneath the fingernails, where they can emerge to a length of 5cm. Their nano-sharp ends enclose electrochemical induction ports, and can slice into skin to reach vulnerable nerves underneath to create excruciating pain or pleasure. This grants the user +20 to Interrogation Tests against prone or restrained subjects or alternatively +20 to Charm Tests against the same."
Optical Mechadendrite,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"This implant is highly flexible and can extend to 3m in length and the thinness of a bullet, with a tip covered with cameras and optical sensors. Ideal for inspection and detection even at the microscopic level, it grants a +10 bonus to all Perception-based tests and may also be used as a telescopic sight. The infra-red torch and sensors incorporated mean no penalties due to darkness and gains the user a +20 bonus to vision-based Perception Tests at night. If the user chooses, the end may also be mounted with a tiny but powerful glow-globe. This mechadendrite may be shoulder or sternum mounted, and a Heretic must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use Talent for operation."
Pheromone Generator,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"A combination of biological glands and injection systems, this implant allows the user to exude unseen but powerful chemicals into the air through modifi ed sweat glands on a Routine (+20) Willpower Test. Charm Tests will gain a +10 bonus, rising to +20 if the test is taken in an enclosed area with little or no strong air movement."
Respiratory Implant,BC,Core,0,Rare,"A simple and reliable procedure, this implant introduces microsieves and filtration screens into the airway so that the Heretic can breath even the most foully polluted Imperial air with no side effect, duplicating the action of a Respirator."
Skeletal Petrifaction,BC,Core,0,Rare,"More a chemical treatment than an implant, metallic fluids are injected into bone marrow in a series of painful operations. The skeletal system incorporates them into the bone structure, making them heavier, stronger, and more damage resistant. A Heretic so altered gains the Bulging Biceps and (often literally) Iron Jaw Talents, and gains a +2 bonus to Damage for all unarmed attacks."
Synthmuscle,BC,Core,0,Rare,"Ropey strands of vat-grown muscle tissue, thick with slurried nutrients and laced with flakweave, are woven into existing muscle groups granting increased strength of varying levels. Heretics gain Unnatural Strength 1; Best Craftsmanship grafts grant Unnatural Strength 4 but also impose a -10 to any Agility Tests due to the newly misshapen and unnatural body shape."
Tox Nails,BC,Core,0,Scarce,"Toxic nails, or something. Iunno man. This one didn't have a description in the Core Rulebook"
Utility Mechadendrite,BC,Core,0,Very Rare,"This 2m mechadendrite incorporates a selection of useful tools and attachments, counting as a combi-tool and granting a +10 bonus to all Tech-Use Tests. It also contains six injector pistons each filled with one dose of Ligature Oil; these must be supplied and replaced separately. The limb is fi tted with a Censer (see page 169), allowing it to billow fumes every 15 minutes with effects depending on the acquired ingredients. This can alternatively belch smoke clouds that may be employed in melee combat to distract and choke, imposing a –5 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests made by all living creatures within a two-metre radius for one round. This is a Half Action. Unless the censer is deactivated, all Perception Tests relying on a sense of smell made to detect the Heretic gain a +10 bonus. Also useful in combat is the cutting blade found at the end of one tip, counting as a knife with the Defensive Quality and Mono upgrade. A Heretic must have the appropriate Mechadendrite Use Talent to operate this implant."
